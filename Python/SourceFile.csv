"Participating in collaborative design discussion may impede the very activity it is supposed to facilitate, causing designers to disattend to listeners' perspectives (speaker centredness) and listeners to assume a more prominent (participatory listening) role in managing common ground. We report an investigation of these hypotheses in the speech and representational activity of teams of pre-expert design engineers engaged in authentic design tasks. Compared with gestural and speech-only discourse, design discourse accompanied by freehand sketching was associated with reduced listener monitoring, speaker-centric design arguments, and speaker-initiated turn-taking and closure. Listeners withdrew from direct and potentially distracting involvement during these presentations, but continued to provide unobtrusive evidence of attentiveness and understanding. These patterns of argumentation and closure point to tacit and intuitive ‘good listenership’ practices, in which listeners actively co-direct the grounding process in sketch discourse by making allowances for the cognitive demands it imposes on their colleagues. We explore the implications of these practices for design education and training, as well as for the use of new technologies for promoting effective design teamwork.""This paper examines some of the features revealed from analysis of the conversational exchanges taking place during two meetings between architects and their building-user clients at an early stage in a building design project. It reveals blurred boundaries between architects' and building users' argumentation positions and the potential of these as conversational moves. As we might expect, we see conversational turns in which each contributes from their own territory of expertise and we see them respond to each others' conversational invitations to supply information. However, we also see tentative excursions, where one party invokes the position or knowledge of the other to propose or justify a design decision, provoking, in turn, an expert response. Incidents such as these, revealed as conversational exchanges, show us how design progression is negotiated collaboratively. They provide us with a way of grasping concretely some of the subtleties of how shared ownership of a design is established within a non-participatory design setting.""Designers are facing new kinds of design tasks beyond their traditional expertise that call for tools and practices to facilitate design collaboration. This article focuses on the relations between probing and issues of collaboration and participation. It first introduces the probes approach and then describes how it has been applied to support collaboration and participation in case studies which have been conducted in the context of design research and company collaboration in Finland. The article also discusses the role of probing in enhancing collaboration. It proposes that the probes approach can have roles in supporting an iterative co-exploring of the design space, as well as in facilitating collaboration with various stakeholders in co-design.""Product design teams, composed of individuals with diverse expertise, communicate continually throughout the realization process, especially during formal collaborative design reviews. Individuals with the required expertise for conducting design reviews may be distributed in different geographic locations requiring either expensive travel or new communication tools to simulate onsite collaborative communication. This paper presents the methods and results of a controlled user study devised to examine the effectiveness of various communication methods for design reviews. Speech-only, text-only, and face-to-face communication methods were chosen to simulate current technologies commonly used in situations of geographic distribution: phone conference, text chat, and onsite meetings, respectively. Primary results from the study include the following: group design reviews in all modes of communication were approximately twice as effective as individual design reviews; face-to-face communication produced a greater perceived effectiveness than speech-only communication; and speech-only communication produced a greater perceived effectiveness than text-only communication. Despite this participant self-reported perceived effectiveness, there was no statistically significant difference between the measured effectiveness of conducting design reviews under different communication-mode scenarios. Review effectiveness was evaluated by a quantitative measure of the number of flaws, non-conformance to the specified requirements that are identified and documented by the design review team. These flaws were intentionally integrated into the product to be reviewed for experimental control.""The automotive industry is an example of flow production and manufacturing efficiency. Its performance is based on making the right decisions on strategic, tactical and operational processes. Discrete-event simulation is the tool of choice to verify such strategic decisions. As the use of the tool is complex, the task of verifying suitable solutions is accomplished by simulation experts and limited to high-priority projects. For the optimisation of operational processes, companies have established lean initiatives with real-time monitoring systems to measure production processes and to reveal bottlenecks. The improvement process is often based on trial and error and could be strongly supported by discrete-event simulation. Based on a use case of an assembly line in the automotive industry, we propose an approach in which running production environments benefit from simulation experiments without any intensive support by simulation experts. Besides introducing a new work procedure, the goal is to extend the current tool set and to simplify the use of discrete-event simulation tools for daily application by production engineers, by providing new visualisation and interaction interfaces to support decisions on tactical measures and, thus, prevent system instabilities and blocked line conditions. Finally, initial results are described in the conclusion to this article.""Consistent excellent performance of operational teams is based on distinctive task performance strategies and a highly structured knowledge base that enable experts to adapt their actions to the various task characteristics and demands, to anticipate adequately future developments and to react to situation changes. Build shared mental models as the central phase of action regulation of problem solving teams.""This study investigates how design artefacts shape interactions among student designers and design reviewers to mediate design and design learning. By analysing data collected from two design courses in mechanical engineering and industrial design courses, this study draws on Winner’s concept of politics of the artefact and Gee’s discourse analysis to explore the ways in which design artefacts help structure social relationships and power dynamics between reviewers and students in design learning settings. We use this exploration to examine how student designers work with reviewers to negotiate meaning as they shift from student to collaborator. Our results indicate that functional and well-developed design artefacts allowed students to position themselves as experts of their designs; engage in collaborative, innovative discussion with design reviewers; and elicit constructive feedback from reviewers. In contrast, students who developed incomplete or inaccurate design artefacts experienced limited dialogue with reviewers and reinforced the power distance between them.""Despite the growing importance of collective intelligence, little is known about the design processes that lead to effective social innovation. A study of communication describes design process visualisations from three sites for collective innovation, in terms of their ability to structure and present design tasks and to situate design communication within the context of these tasks. Empirical data on design communication provide the basis for protocol studies on three project forums from a website for social product design. Mechanisms were identified which describe ways in which collective innovation produces successful solutions shaped by community input: (1) structuring design as a hybrid process, which combines online communities for design development and appointed experts or inbuilt system features for technical and organisational aspects; (2) providing distinct roles for users to assume and manageable tasks for them to perform; (3) clarifying task requirements; and (4) supporting social communication to strengthen the impact of ideas, with particular focus on the social processes of ideation and evaluation. A framework is defined for structuring and understanding the management of collective innovation processes and the roles of participants. These findings have significant practical and theoretical implications for social innovation.""When developing a successor of an existing product, it is relatively easy to involve consumers at the early stages of the process—one could, for example, observe them using the current products, and discuss with them what could be improved. However, when creating novel products from ‘scratch’, consumers might find it difficult to articulate future needs, to appreciate the potential and limitations of new technologies, or think about possible applications. So, consumer co-creation in the early creative phase does not seem to be feasible. Other approaches to include the consumer perspective need to be considered. Furthermore, product innovation is increasingly about how to create an appealing and alluring experience, bringing further challenges to the innovation process. A promising approach seems to be bringing together domain experts from different backgrounds, creating a setting in which barriers between disciplines can disappear, and adopting a user-centric, rapid iterative investigation, ideation, prototyping and development process.""Design for (every)one is a macro framework that attempts to identify, share and use ‘hidden solutions’ in community-based rehabilitation contexts and translate them into disruptive assistive devices built with local resources or appropriate technology. Within healthcare contexts, local solutions are frequently more effective as they reflect the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of specific patients and engage all stakeholders in a specific local context. By using open horizontal innovation networks, where assistive devices can be easily shared and physically hacked by other allied health professionals, general patterns can be detected and translated into standard universal design objects. This generative design thinking approach is more than feasible with digital trends such as crowd sourcing, user-generated content and peer production. Cheap and powerful prototyping tools have become easier to use by non-engineers; it turns them into users as well as self-manufacturers of their personal assistive artefacts. This paper discusses the different aspects of this open innovation process within a ‘design for disability’ context and suggests the first steps in an iterative co-design methodology that brings together expertise from professional designers, occupational therapists, patients and other stakeholders. The overall aim is to gain more insights into designing qualitative occupational experiences for disabled users.""Textiles are increasingly complex materials used in a growing number of applications, e.g. in architecture. The textile industry must therefore engage with other professions when developing both textiles and products of which textiles are a part. In this article, we argue that tools taken from the field of participatory design represent a potential for staging such co-design situations and report on our experience from a co-design process where architects, engineers and textile experts engaged in designing future textile solutions for Danish hospital environments. During this process we used what we call tangible working materials to stage the collaboration between the stakeholders engaged as co-designers. Our experience using the tangible working materials showed us that they can be divided into three types, with different attributes and roles in the design process: real, mediating and representative materials.""In order to understand how collaboration between people from different disciplines takes place, research is being undertaken in the area of art and technology. The present paper describes three studies of collaboration between artists and technologists drawn from the COSTART (COmputer SupporT for ARTists) project, an artist-in-residency programme that provided a platform for studying the creative process. The paper describes how case studies were carried out and, in particular, how the data analysis was conducted using a coding framework developed specifically for this art-technology context and what the preliminary findings that have emerged were.""Participatory design (PD) has become increasingly engaged in public spheres and everyday life and is no longer solely concerned with the workplace. This is not only a shift from work-oriented productive activities to leisure and pleasurable engagements, but also a new milieu for production and ‘innovation’. What ‘democratic innovation’ entails is often currently defined by management and innovation research, which claims that innovation has been democratised through easy access to production tools and lead-users as the new experts driving innovation. We sketch an alternative ‘innovation’ practice more in line with the original visions of PD based on our experience of runningMalmö Living Labs – an open innovation milieu where new constellations, issues and ideas evolve from bottom–up long-term collaborations among diverse stakeholders. Three cases and controversial matters of concern are discussed. The fruitfulness of the concepts ‘agonistic public spaces’ (as opposed to consensual decision-making), ‘thinging’ and ‘infrastructuring’ (as opposed to projects) are explored in relation to democracy, innovation and other future-making practices.""Contextmapping techniques have been tried and tuned for participants in Western cultures and are known to provide inspiration in the conceptual phase of design. Because these techniques rely heavily on activities such as expressing feelings in public and discussing in groups, they are less attuned to participants from more ‘reserved’ cultures, e.g. East Asia. In this project we adapted the techniques for use with East Asian participants. Our findings indicate that, when conducted in appropriate forms, contextmapping techniques can work in East Asia. However, more than in the West, a well-demarcated script is needed. By ‘script’ we mean a construct that frames the roles of the participants and the researcher, and provides a clear stage on which the participant plays the role of ‘expert of his experience’ and outside of which he/she is free from the burden of expressing him- or herself. The importance of a script in East Asia led us to review the value of scripting and staging as design parameter for the techniques in general.""Spatial designers, who engage children in their design process, most often frame children in this context as experts in their own lives. Findings from a study based at the University of Sheffield, point to new understandings of this participatory role, in which children move towards the role of designer. Drawing on interviews including visual methods with 16 spatial designers and guided by phenemonography, the paper seeks to represent the designers’ perspectives on the under-explored area of child–designer interactions. Findings suggest that the designers understand these interactions to comprise a reciprocal and co-created space – a sphere of behaviours, actions and ways of being which together becomes an enabler of change. It is proposed that what Bhabha (The Location of Culture, 1994) refers to as a ‘Third Space’ in which the ‘dominant culture might be temporarily subverted and its structural systems of power and control renegotiated’ can be re-imagined in this co-design context. The paper weaves together theoretical discourse and empirical illustrations of perceived creativity, play and transgression, which – at their intersection – support a potential transformation of understandings of children as co-designers and of the design process itself.""This study examines the use of online tools to conduct generative research. We focus on the contextmapping procedure, which consists of several stages: the preparation stage, the sensitisation stage, the session stage, the analysis stage, and the communication stage. In the preparation stage, the target group and the aim of the study are defined. In the sensitisation stage, participants are introduced to the topic under study. In the session stage, participants are encouraged to create several collages and discuss these in a group. The resulting discussions are then analysed and communicated to designers to serve as input for design concepts.""In this paper the authors discuss a new interdisciplinary project which integrates product design innovations from IDEO, in particular experience prototyping, and touches upon aspects of Eddie Obeng's design paradigms such as fog andquest. The project, ‘Artefact after the Fact’ weaves experience design directly into a New York study trip, which is then further developed by interdisciplinary student teams within a neutral studio space. The authors describe this process, involving 120 students from 5 design disciplines with a staff team with expertise ranging from Product to Interiors, and with contextual input from the School of Architecture, Design History Theory & Practice. Mediating artefacts (convenient shorthand for ‘product’ objects, as experiential metaphors for process and product) are explored, which may be relevant to engineering students, or other ‘non’ product disciplines. As educators, there is much we can learn from industry, but much we need to be wary of within design education; modular inflexibility, reduced teaching time, and a growing obsession with grades collectively threaten the kind of ‘connected’, ‘holistic’ and experimental ‘experiential learning’ which institutions exist to foster, industry demands, and learners need. Interdisciplinary learning echoes those types of product innovations and collaborative and critical team working valued in the creative industries, and in this context, is a means of exploring the changing nature of product design (the experience economy rather than just the object economy). Interdisciplinarity lets us tentatively cross, and challenge, imaginary disciplinary boundaries, and in sharing our imaginations we transform our horizons.""A visual notation called the interaction dynamics notation was used for analysing the moment-to-moment interpersonal interactions in design reviews. The expressions of professional vision (PV) – a system of seeing and interpreting that characterises a professional group – are identified in these design review interactions. The analysis showed that students’ participation was important to the articulation of PV in design reviews. Specifically, there were four interaction patterns – question-asking, supportive behaviour, building-on behaviour and humour that were associated with nine types of PV expressions in design review interactions. These interaction patterns are examined in the context of existing literature on design reviews. The implication of using the visual representation of review interactions as an educational tool is explored.""This paper presents an experiment in which people performed a co-design task in urban design, using a multi-user touch table application with or without interactive model simulations. We hypothesised that using the interactive model simulations would improve communication and co-operation between co-design participants, would help participants to develop shared understanding and would positively affect the co-design process and its outcomes. However, our experiment (involving 60 people in 20 co-design sessions) only partly confirmed these hypotheses. People positively evaluated the interactive model simulation tools (an interactive map of an urban area, interactive models for traffic, sound, sight and safety, and ‘tangibles’), and these tools promoted communication and co-operation, and the exploration of design solutions. However, people's experiences of social cohesion and their satisfaction with their own contribution to the co-design process were better without these tools, possibly because using these tools drew people's attention towards these interactive model simulations and away from the dynamics between the participants. We therefore advocate using such tools selectively, for example, early on in a co-design process, to improve shared understanding of the contents of the problem, rather than later on, when people need to focus on their fellow participants and on the processes of communication and co-operation.""Designers have been moving increasingly closer to the future users of what they design and the next new thing in the changing landscape of design research has become co-designing with your users. But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe.""This naturalistic study focuses on how the co-design of educational software is an activity mediated by and through communicative resources. The aim is to identify how design suggestions and the use of resources emerge in co-design. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding aspects of collaboration in design. To understand the phenomenon of collaboration in design, we apply interaction analysis, dialogism and the sociocultural perspective to show which resources the participants use and how they negotiate design suggestions. We argue that such understanding is only visible through detailed analysis of naturally occurring co-design activities. We find that the design trajectory varies in how the participants orient themselves to each other and in relation to the design artefacts. Tensions make visible which communicative resources are sensitive to what the participants interpret as relevant in the context of their institutional norms and values. Their different positions must be negotiated. Together, these aspects orient the design and mediate the emerging consensus and design artefact.""In any product development process, team collaboration is a key to success. Especially, multidisciplinary and global teamwork is vital in finding a comprehensive solution in product development. But inherent gaps between the participating disciplines and cultures cause disputes and misunderstandings when collaborating. This paper shows the challenges in interdisciplinary and intercultural teamwork, which have to be overcome in order to advance an integrated product development process. The purpose of this research is to improve mutual accommodation in multidisciplinary and international teamwork with the support of modern information technology and technical product documentation.""In any product development process, team collaboration is a key to success.

Designers need to capitalise on the strengths of different stakeholders to develop shared knowledge and practices to better deal with the complexity of problems facing society today. This study builds on research concerning social processes in design activity through exploring professional designers' perspectives on the significance of collaboration in their work. Twenty-three semi-structured in-context interviews were conducted with professional designers from 13 different professional specialisations. The interview data were analysed using a grounded theory interpretive approach. The insights developed from the analysis suggest that the development of support for collaborative design should target not only methods of solving design problems, but also informal and social interactions that bring together different stakeholders while respecting their differences. Further research in this area would enhance the effectiveness of collaboration and increase designers' ability to participate in the early stages of product development for complex problems.""As the focus of product design has shifted from exclusively commercial to sustainability and social concerns, design education in this area has endeavoured to keep pace. Victor Papanek's book Design for the real world, crystallised many of the systemic social, economic and environmental concerns into an argument for change through eco-design, inclusive design and, in business and corporate contexts, a triple bottom line of social, environmental and economic factors. Simultaneously, design has developed and evolved participatory and co-design approaches, with high-profile consultancies such as IDEO proving that early involvement of designers with ‘wicked’ social and environmental problems is possible. This position paper revisits Papanek's agenda for industrial design, and examines the link with participatory approaches, and existing socially responsible design agendas and examples. Identifying eight critical features of socially sustainable product design, this paper suggests that Papanek's original agenda for socially responsible and sustainable design has been partly fulfilled and must be developed further through the changed role of the designer as facilitator of flexible design solutions that meet local needs and resources.""In this paper we argue that it is not self-evident how ‘requirements’ are defined, but that ‘requirements’ are enacted differently by differently situated actors, and that this has consequences in design practices. The purpose of the paper is to explore the consequences of prototyping practices in a local IT design project. The empirical material was gathered through the use of ethnographic methods, and analysed diffractively. Graphical user interface prototypes were tools for formulating business requirements in a business process analysis. Through a reading of a discussion which took place in a work meeting about the prototypes, we discuss how business requirements were enacted. This is discussed in relation to divergent and convergent approaches in IT design. One consequence was a risk that the prototyping process moved too fast to solutions, and another was the risk that the business process analysis method reproduced the dominant story of women's absence in IT design.""This paper presents an empirical comparison of idea generation within the context of reducing the number of single occupancy car journeys to and from a UK university campus. Separate co-design and consultative groups were matched with respect to (1) creativity when problem solving, (2) normal commuting mode and (3) intention to adopt sustainable behaviours. The co-design group generated a significantly greater number of innovative ideas than the consultative group (using an email-based methodology); however, this was due to the greater number of total ideas (rather than the higher proportion of innovative ideas) generated by this group. The co-design group was able to think more systemically about potential solutions and generate proposals that were not either linked to their own commute mode, or aligned with any one specific mode of transport. The findings suggest that co-design offers benefits as a process for idea generation within the sustainable travel context as it promotes idea generation and a more holistic perspective on the problem and potential solutions.""Video and transcripts of two architectural design meetings are presented in an analysis of a specific design process. The focus of the analysis presented here is the social and cultural aspects of cognition in design. The argument begins with a discussion of the parallels in design studies and cognitive science as each has begun to consider the importance of environmental influences on how we design and how we think. By applying three situated frameworks to understand the situated nature of design meetings, the analysis shows that notions of social creation and cultural cognition are complementary and necessary for a holistic understanding of the collaborative design process.""This paper argues for a consistent and new design-specific disciplinary framework that will provide a better understanding of emergent design practice. Design today is characterised by a blurring of traditional design domains (Sanders 2006Sanders, E. B.N. 2006.Design research in 2006.Design Research Quarterly, 1(1): 1–8.) and design activities that are backed by other subject specialist areas such as computing, electronics or bioengineering. In order to understand and facilitate collaborative working, a consistent disciplinary framework is required. Furthermore, in understanding complex disciplinary influences this framework provides a method of delineating and analysing emergent practice. To derive the framework this paper explores the existing literature on disciplinary terms. Contemporary creative design practice is then analysed via this taxonomy. To this end, the paper argues that through consistent use of the terms, ‘multidisciplinary design’, ‘crossdisciplinary design’, ‘interdisciplinary design’ and ‘transdisciplinary design’, distinctions can be made within the increasingly complex domain of contemporary design practice.""This paper describes a new approach to cooperative design using distributed, off-the-shelf design components. The ultimate goal is to enable assemblers to rapidly design their products and perform simulations using parts that are offered by a global network of suppliers. The obvious way to realise this goal would be to transfer desired component models to the client computer. However, in order to protect proprietary data, manufacturers are reluctant to share their design models without non-disclosure agreements, which can take in the order of months to put in place. Due to bandwidth limitations, it is also impractical to keep the models at the manufacturer site and do simulations by simple message passing. To deal with these impediments in e-commerce the modular distributed modelling (MDM) methodology is leveraged, which enables transfer of component models while hiding proprietary implementation details. MDM methodology with routine design (RD) methods are augmented to realise a platform (RD-MDM) that enables automatic selection of secured off-the-shelf design components over the Internet, integration of these components in an assembly, running simulations for design testing and publishing the approved product model as a secured MDM agent. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of the RD-MDM platform on a fuel cell–battery hybrid vehicle design example.""Among those involved in human–computer interaction (HCI) and user-centred design (UCD) the idea of co-design mainly applies to the software developer organisation and the users. In mainstream HCI research and in the literature only a few attend to the co-creation that occurs between IT acquirers and either users or software developers. Interaction design is central when it comes to designing a system that shows a high degree of use quality; often the interaction designer is working at the IT department and thus is ‘owned’ by the developers. This paper describes a case study of how procurers and interaction designers view the procurement process, the intention being to inform and improve the way that co-design is performed among procurers and developers. The study is conducted in an organisation that chose to include the interaction design competence as part of the software acquisition organisation; we look at how different actors in the organisation view interaction design and how interaction design contributes to the software acquisition process. The interaction designers wish to work with more experienced procurers who know what they want. The procurers, on the other hand, want more control over the initial process, but are worried about how to present their requirements to the IT developers.""Design in many settings is an inherently collective and creative undertaking, with phenomena of emergence at the heart of the activity. Cognitive accounts of emergence in the context of design have not taken its collective nature into account. At the same time, accounts of collective emergence do not recognise certain salient attributes of design, including the importance of visual thinking and various media for external representation. With reference to two distinct theories of emergence, Oxman's account of design emergence in terms of visual cognition, and Sawyer's account of collaborative emergence in conversation and performance, this paper reports results from a study of a high-performing, technologically mediated concurrent design practice. On-site observation, interviews, and video interaction analysis were used to render the creative process of engineering design in fine-grained detail. The resulting insights support aspects of both theories in that creative activity appears to proceed substantially through modalities of visual cognition, while collaborative products are arrived at through an essentially collective process involving multiple participants and unpredictable developments. The combined view presents a richer picture of collective emergence in design than either theory alone provides.""This article provides an overview of research into mental models in teams and discusses the relevance of this theoretical concept for design teams. Researchers in several disciplines have applied the construct of mental models to understand how people perform tasks based on their knowledge, experience and expectation. The notion has also been used to study teams and to analyse the relationship between team mental model and team performance. Five different types of mental models for studying design teams are proposed: task, process, team, competence, and context. A review the literature found only very few studies on team mental models in design-related areas. A brief overview is provided on what is known about team mental models in general, on the effect of team mental models on team performance, and on what kind of results can be transferred to design teams. A short review of measurement techniques and how they can be applied to design research is presented. Finally, implications for the field of design are discussed and a methodological framework for studying mental models in design teams is proposed.""This paper seeks to make the case for socially responsive design. It does this by offering a broad contexualisation of previous accounts of design, including those made in this special issue, and by proposing new and useful ways of understanding the need to address multiple actors and design agendas in the design process. The paper also reviews and identifies problems with some ideas about collaboration and agency in the context of social design and design-led social innovation. It suggests that equitable arrangements between stakeholders are essential to ensure the successful delivery of design for social change in the real world. It also argues that robust socially responsive design and innovation methodologies and engagement strategies are essential, and need to be mindfully applied by designers seeking to make effective and appropriate contributions to meeting societal goals in new, sustainable ways.""In human-centred design (HCD), researchers and designers attempt to cooperate with and learn from potential users of the products or services which they are developing. Their goal is to develop products or services that match users’ practices, needs and preferences. In this position paper it is argued that HCD practitioners need to deal with two tensions that are inherent in HCD: they need to combine and balance users’ knowledge and ideas with their own knowledge and ideas; and they need to combine and balance a concern for understanding current or past practices with a concern for envisioning alternative or future practices. Six HCD approaches – participatory design, ethnography, the lead user approach, contextual design, codesign and empathic design – are discussed in order to argue that these different approaches are different ways to cope with the two tensions. In addition, several examples from practice are provided to illustrate these tensions. Moreover, it is advocated that HCD practitioners critically reflect on their practices, their methods and their own involvement, so that they can more consciously follow specific HCD approaches and more mindfully cope with the two tensions.""This paper contextualises the emergence and continuing development of the Design for Health and Wellbeing (DHW) Lab, a collaboration between a university and a hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. The DHW Lab was established with the vision of creating a design space in which designers, students, patients and hospital staff could work together to identify and address contemporary healthcare issues in innovative ways. In this paper, we explain how the continuing development of the space reflects the design principles it espouses, and how this is embedding design principles and practices into a healthcare organisation. In particular, we will show how the users of the space contribute to the evolution of its physical appearance, its values and its performance as they come to identify and make sense of the challenges, possibilities and potential of the DHW Lab initiative.""This paper seeks to redefine ‘user participation in design’ and to articulate new roles for designers in order to transform design processes. The term ‘Design Participation’ was introduced in the 1971 Design Research Society conference. The main focus of this paper is to suggest ways to tackle three areas that have been neglected over 30 years of Design Participation development, namely: the aesthetic quality of design practice, the collaborative relationship of design research and participatory design thinking. The paper is a reflection by a professional designer developed through the experience of working with different groups in action research projects and these concrete case studies are used to illustrate the developing theory. Three areas of challenges were identified and the overall aim was to facilitate innovative collaboration and create platforms for social inclusion in design practice. Addressing these challenges, it is essential to reconsider the roles of designers (design developer, facilitator and generator) in order to achieve user participation in design. However, in order to avoid tokenism, the most important thing is to practice these roles as tactics of Design Participation.""A new figure emerges within participatory design, that of a user subject, who not only participates in design processes, but who is to subsequently design-in-use on their own. Like ‘the subject supposed to know’, identified by Jacques Lacan as central to the contemporary production of knowledge, this subject is susceptible to both administrative regulation and to forms of hegemonic power its social design projects might trigger. Characterising this subject’s current response to such situations are various attempts to develop in a ‘reflexive’ manner. This reaction appears, however, to sustain the subject supposed to design in a state of political vulnerability. Alternatively, potential exists for the subject to avoid these outcomes where its social projects are re-sculpted in a ‘reflective’ manner: in keeping with dialectical contradictions which spring open as decision ‘points’ between the explanatory, diagnostic and normative semblances of design objects approached as ‘design Things’. The situation of the Land and Water Forum of Aotearoa New Zealand illustrates these matters.""The present study investigates the role of visual access in supporting the exchange of positive evidence of mutual understanding in collaborative design. Pairs of designers worked on two design problems differing in the mix of gestural and speech cues needed to signal mutual understanding, either in full view of each other, or within each others' hearing but without shared visual access to each others' design activities. Designers' use of conversational speech, gesture, and representational media varied systematically as they adjusted to the loss of visual access. Nevertheless, they did achieve acceptable design solutions under these conditions. The changing patterns of conversational and workspace activity we observed have the potential to inform the design and application of augmented reality interfaces that attempt seamlessly to blend real and virtual images and objects, and we draw out some human factors implications of these interfaces for helping designers think and share design ideas.""A community-building approach was employed in a small mid-western town bounded by the Ohio River. Community members were involved in a riverfront development project through a variety of activities such as students brainstorming their ideas, and surveys that generated over 200 ideas for the riverfront. Idea-sharing sessions were also held with neighborhood focus groups to gauge the views of a cross-section of citizens about the future development of the riverfront. These activities culminated in a community workshop where 130 citizens began the planning process by revisiting the riverfront through a narrated photographic tour, and reviewing a video summary of the focus groups. Twenty-two groups then identified recreation objectives and located activities on a map of the riverfront. Workshop results formed the basis for a subsequent design proposal followed by implementation of the first phase.""This comment refers to two central concepts of Badke-Schaub et al.'s lead paper, the functionality of mental models for coping with the complexity of reality and sharedness as a prerequisite of group performance. For both ideas, a trade-off perspective is introduced. Major functionalities of mental models, e.g. organization of knowledge, not only provide benefits but also costs, e.g. oversimplification of a problem. The degree to what individual mental models in a team need to be shared in order to manage a task depends on multiple factors, e.g. the nature of the task and the developmental stage of the team. Related to the specific tasks of design teams, the idea of optimal sharedness is elaborated and conclusions on task-oriented processes in design teams are drawn.""This paper describes a collaboration that resulted in the development of a coding scheme for the analysis of interactive art experience. The collaboration involved a multidisciplinary team of analysts who went through an iterative process of coding development in order to reach agreement on what to code, how to code and what to expect from the outcomes. The present paper discusses the influence that this collaborative process had on the final scheme and provides a general description of the coding scheme. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential value of the scheme for the analysis of interactive art experience.""This study of student teams learning to design in an engineering course highlights the role of collaborative interaction for understanding innovative design. A modelling approach was adopted to explore the arc of work and learning represented by the teams' final designs. The macro timescale process of design comprised mesoscale projects and microscale interactions and decisions. Social network analysis of student reflections on interactions and collaboration provided mesoscale summary statistics of team interactions at various time points along the design process. Teams viewed as having innovative initial design plans, who scored higher on microscale design skills of perspective-taking and who had higher team cohesion, tended to produce more innovative final designs. Implications for investigating and fostering collective and everyday creativity are discussed.""This special issue of CoDesign presents papers selected from work initially presented at the 10th Design Thinking Research Symposium (DTRS 10), which took place at Purdue University in the fall of 2014 (Adams and Siddiqui 2016Adams, R. S., and J.Siddiqui, eds. 2016.Analyzing Design Review Conversations. West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press.). Working from a common data set, the participants of DTRS 10 analysed video, transcript and artefactual data from a variety of disciplinary and methodological lenses. The goal of the DTRS international symposium series is to create an environment where researchers from a variety of design-related disciplines can come together to explore the nature and nurture of designexpertise. DTRS 10 is also part of an ongoing history of collaborative inquiry into common research data sets that McDonnell and Lloyd (2009aMcDonnell, J., and P.Lloyd, eds. 2009a. About: Designing – Analysing Design Meetings. London:Taylor & Francis.) describe as a ‘landmark in design thinking research’: Analysing design activity for DTRS 2 (Dorst 1995Dorst, K. 1995. “Analysing Design Activity: New Directions in Protocol Analysis.” Special Issue of Design Studies 16 (2):139–142.; Cross, Christiaans and Dorst 1996Cross, N., H. Christiaans, and K. Dorst, eds. 1996.Analysing Design Activity.Chichester: John Wiley.), About: designing – analysing design meetings for DTRS 7 (McDonnell and Lloyd 2009aMcDonnell, J., and P.Lloyd, eds. 2009a. About: Designing – Analysing Design Meetings. London:Taylor & Francis., 2009bMcDonnell, J., and P.Lloyd eds. 2009b.Analysing Design Conversations. Special Issue of CoDesign 5 (1):1–4.) and Articulating Design Thinkingfor DTRS 9 (Rodgers 2012Rodgers, P., ed. 2012.Articulating Design Thinking. Farringdon:Libri., 2013Rodgers, P., ed. 2013. “Articulating Design Thinking.” Special Issue of Design Studies 34 (4):433–437.). The 2014 symposium theme was ‘design review conversations’ – conversations between those who give and those who receive feedback, guidance, critique or mentoring during a design review. Design reviews are a fundamental aspect of design education and practice and provide a fertile venue for making manifest design thinking. Design coaches draw on their prior experience to point out strengths and weaknesses, call attention to potential roadblocks and provide alternatives to consider in order to help students improve their work. Students must justify and explain their ideas, modelling professional behaviour in the process and, through reflective practice, hone their own design thinking and develop their own professional identities. Frequently, design reviews revolve around an artefact and the interactions, both material and social, which surround its description and evaluation. As such, design reviews contain abundant non-textual and non-verbal information. By providing a video data set of design reviews, the organisers of DTRS 10 attempted to make this rich source of information available to researchers for analysis. The shared data set, made available to symposium participants 10 months prior to the conference, contained 81 videos with time-stamped transcripts and associated project documentation, syllabi and summative evaluation reports (Adams 2016 Adams, R. S. 2016. “Design Review Conversations: The Dataset.” Chap. 2 in Analyzing Design Review Conversations, edited by R. S. Adams and J. Siddiqui, 23–30. West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press.). To enable breadth of perspective and comparative analyses, the disciplines included in the master data set spanned choreography, entrepreneurial design, industrial design, mechanical engineering and service learning design (see Table 1). Review types included individual and group, formal and informal, interim and final (Oh, Ishizaki, Gross, and Do 2012 Oh, Y., S. Ishizaki, M. D. Gross, and E. Y. Do. 2012. “A Theoretical Framework of Design Critiquing in Architecture Studios.” Design Studies 34 (3): 302–325.). In most cases, data were gathered from the same student groups multiple times over the duration of their design project. These design review conversations provided a common focus of inquiry for symposium participants to apply diverse perspectives and methodologies and fostered multiple perspective collaborative inquiry as participants came together to share findings and seek connections across papers before, during and after the symposium. Collectively, participants generated substantive connections across perspectives, contributed to existing theories or frameworks, and generated new perspectives and approaches that broaden or challenge existing perspectives.""This article aims to explore how ANT might help us to rethink collaborative and participatory design (C&PD) practices through converting Bruno Latour's call for risky accounts to a call for design things together. What if ANT starts to be in the business of designing new pieces of technology and not just actor-network accounts of them? What would the design process and its outcomes look like? In response to these questions and to the challenge of co-habitation as vital condition for our technical democracy, I propose three turns in C&PDs. The first is ontological and suggests to design actor networks and to look for ways to make these networks visible. The second is methodological and suggests reimagining co-design as actor networking in public, aided by a much-needed cartography of design. The last is epistemological: it is concerned with what knowledge should inform action in the design process, and it proposes to the idea of the designer as an agnostic Prometheus.""This study examined the contribution of a co-design approach to science teachers’ situated professional development, and explored its effect on student learning and motivation. Study participants were three science teachers who were members of a co-design team; one of the teachers enacted the designed learning environment with her 11th grade, non-science major students. Data were collected from 31 design meetings over two years, teacher interviews, and from pre-post student learning and motivation assessments. Findings indicated that the co-design approach addressed teachers’ reform-based professional development needs, had greater impact on the enacting teacher, and met the enacting students’ learning and motivation needs. The findings talk to the potential of co-design as a successful approach for teachers’ reform-based, situated professional development.""Design is an inherently complex activity. Design thinking is cognitively complex and design practice is contextually complex. This has implications for university-level design education which has traditionally displayed clear distinctions between the full-time and part-time 4undergraduate sectors, particularly in their teaching and learning strategies. However, a number of pressures and trends are evident which suggest that these two sectors are moving closer together. One of the drivers in this phenomenon is the need for students to be exposed to realistic levels of design complexity. This paper examines complexity in design and draws some significant parallels between modern design practice in general and the production of a new undergraduate course at the Open University. Both are used to illuminate design complexity. The paper suggests that some of the tools, techniques and approaches of part-time, undergraduate, distance design education might usefully be exploited in more traditional, full-time course models.""This paper presents the results of an experiment in teaching participatory design for social inclusion based on an interdisciplinary effort between sociologists and design researchers to study design participation for social inclusion. Using their experiences from the Design.Lives Lab 2009, the researchers adopted a phenomenological perspective to analyse the extent to which co-design relationships are interrupted by designers' natural attitudes and the possibility of employing the concept of layers of embodied relationship to improve participatory design. It was found that the natural attitudes of designers can lead to an unbalanced relationship between designers and potential users, resulting in a lack of concern for designers' sensitivity to the spatial dimension of the designer-and-user relationship. With the potential impact of designers' natural attitudes in mind, it is suggested that interrelated layers of empathy are practised as a process to provide more opportunities to understand users' experience. These findings offer a different perspective on the form, extent and nature of co-creation. This experience could help to formulate an agenda for developing design education for participatory design and social inclusion. The effort to find suitable methods would help novice designers to develop skills and sensitivities that would eventually enable them to establish a genuine co-creation process in design.""This article seeks to provide a review of research on museum visiting which has particular relevance for exhibition design. It focuses on empirical studies carried out in a range of social and cultural disciplines. The article begins with an overview of some of the main directions that have been reported in museum visitor study, in particular a shift towards considering visitors as ‘active’ and to looking at affective and embodied dimensions of the visitor experience as well as at the cognitive and ideational. It then looks in more detail at findings and attempts to build a conceptual vocabulary in three related areas of museum visitor research: media, sociality and space. In addition to assessing the state-of-play so far, the article seeks to outline areas for future research.""This paper explores the process of involving the whole school community, especially teachers and students, in the design of schools. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with a range of professionals who have worked with target users in this development process. The interviews were transcribed and then common themes from each of the interviews were developed. Findings suggest that a host of opportunities arise from the special mix of different processes, professions and people involved in school design, but that these are not always being recognised or exploited. The need to acknowledge the opportunities which lie within the process and to not just be fixed on the product – the finished school – appears to be significant. It transpires that the perception of the process from the different perspectives of all involved has an impact on the way in which the process unfolds. The proposed outline model conceptualises the school design process as a collection of opportunities which can arise from collaborative working. Suggestions are made for further research.""Designers develop skills and knowledge through experience and feedback – feedback from colleagues, clients, supervisors, users, stakeholders, or the success or failure of a solution and design instructors. However, the design coaches (instructors and industry clients) and design students must negotiate ambiguity in the feedback process. In this article, we investigate visualisation within a design critique setting, where the industrial design instructor and the students are navigating ambiguity while the instructor is providing feedback on the design work. Using a constitutive research approach, we investigate the relationships among visualisation, ambiguity and critique, where each of these components offers a lens into understanding how designers use the tensions within ambiguity and clarity to achieve designs that fulfil assignments or other purposes. As part of this process, we characterise differences between the ways the instructor and the student interact with the human and non-human agents. The negotiations of ambiguity among human and non-human agents through and within the constitutive processes of visualisation offers fresh insights into how design is accomplished as well as how visualisation can be expanded productively in design education contexts.""This article compares participatory workshops with novel mixed-reality tabletop tools in three different urban projects. It discusses differences of site and project, the role of representations, and the role of the participating stakeholders as factors that are crucial in shaping the space for design ideas. The article then draws conclusions as to the salient aspects of creative, explorative and imaginative exploration.""Interactive art is, by its very nature, concerned with audience experience. The interaction is the essence the meaning of the work to the participant. An embodied cognition framework may be used to explore individual's cognition within a cognitive system while he or she is engaged in an interactive art experience. A cognitive system is identified as a system of interactions between the participants, the tools and the environment engaged in the experience. The aim of this paper is to characterize a person's interactive experience of different artworks using an embodied cognition framework in which bodily interaction, thought and perception of feedback are examined. The protocol analysis used to characterize participant experiences is shown to be an appropriate method for investigating interactivity in the art context. The results showed that identifying the presence of interactions between body and feedback, body and thought and thought and feedback provides an effective way to characterize each artwork experience. We discuss how these modes of interactions can be used as a measure for investigating other interactive artwork experiences in future work.""Maker spaces and maker activities offering access to low-cost digital fabrication equipment are rapidly proliferating, evolving phenomena at the interface of lay and professional design. They also come in many varieties and change fast, presenting a difficult target for, for instance, public authorities, who would like to cater for them but operate in much slower planning cycles. As part of participatory planning of Helsinki Central Library, we experimented with a form of collaborative futuring with and by makers. By drawing elements from both lead-user workshops and participatory design, we conducted a futuring workshop, which allowed us to engage the local maker communities in identifying the issues relevant for a public maker space in 2020. It further engaged the participants in envisioning a smaller prototype maker space and invited them into realising its activities collaboratively. Our results indicate that particularly the information about future solutions was of high relevance, as was the opportunity to trial and elaborate activities on a rolling basis in the prototype space. Insights about more general trends in making were useful too, but to a lesser extent, and it is likely that these could have been gained just as easily with more traditional means for futuring.""Object sharing in computer supported collaborative designrequires multiple participants not only to be able to modify design objects when participating in a collaborative design scenario, but also be able to query them for specific information. Especially in the design of complex artefacts, such as buildings, as the relationships that need to be tracked and dependencies between the participants and created objects increase, so do the difficulties of converging on a single design. Often the shared objects are represented with their most salient design attributes, such as geometric information, to assist computer supported collaborative work (CSCW). Capturing non-geometric information in CSCW requires a shift in the way design objects are represented and queried. In this paper, we present our work in computer aided requirement traceability for architectural design, which addresses an alternative way to parse design objects to assist object sharing in collaborative design.""The concept of vernacular design allows for the understanding and the appreciation of designs created without recourse to institutional qualifications in the field of design. A study was undertaken of how North Alaska Inuit (Eskimo) women learn design—based on observations, interviews with seamstresses, and authorial participation in designing and sewing in conformity with North Alaska Inuit tradition, everything filmed on digital video. This has been the empirical basis for an interpretation inspired by the social learning theory of Wenger in his ‘Communities of Practice’, an approach that promises to be of particular relevance to future research into the learning of design because it stresses the social aspect of learning, important in investigations of the social process of designing. A main conclusion of this research is the importance of learning-by-watching, which will be of great importance in further research of the learning process of professional or academic design.""Facilitating participation has become one of the cornerstones of co-design, and a number of methods, techniques and events intended to inspire design participants and scaffold collaborative ideation and concept development have been developed. However, an aspect that is yet relatively unexplored in co-design literature is how different methods and techniques can be productively combined. This paper presents and discusses the dialogue-labs method, which provides a structured way of generating ideas through a sequence of co-design activities. The analysis of the method during 18 sessions, based on iterative reflection, focuses on its three key structuring aspects: the process of how dialogue-labs sessions are orchestrated, the space in which the sessions unfold and the materials that are employed. In addition to understanding the specific dialogue-labs method, this discussion of process, space and materials may yield insights into how other co-design methods are analysed and further developed or combined.""This paper discusses the co-design process developed in the Winter School, a course run by the Designing Out Crime (DOC) research centre at the University of Technology, Sydney. Projects undertaken in this course address crime prevention from a holistic, designerly perspective that contrasts with traditional approaches such as crime prevention through environmental design. The design collaboration at the Winter School involves partner organisations, the DOC team and students, all of whom work together to develop innovative design concepts that improve community well-being and safety. This paper illustrates, using three project examples, the advantages and challenges of applying the co-design process in the domain of socially responsive design.""Product personalisation gives individual consumers the opportunity to act as co-designers and partly determine the appearance or functionality of the product they buy. Whether product personalisation can provide a competitive advantage depends on how it is implemented in new products and to which target group it is aimed. This article presents a classification study to uncover the dimensions of product personalisation to provide designers with an overview of the spectrum of personalisation options. Our research distinguishes the following seven dimensions: Mental effort, Physical effort, Flexibility, Initiation, Goal of product personalisation, Personalisation moment, and Deliberateness. On the basis of the outcomes of the study, new personalisation options can be developed. In addition, specific implications for targeting consumers are discussed.""The paper is concerned with the design of virtual environments for collaborative design (VECD) – a particular class of collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) that focus on supporting design activities. VECD are becoming essential collaboration platforms for many designers and their clients, in a wide range of design domains including product, interior, architectural, automotive design, etc. However, the contemporary design considerations of VECD are mainly driven by systematic approaches that do not reflect upon knowledge regarding requirements that stem out of everyday collaborative design activities. A consequence is that they do not yield methodical guidance to designers of VECD applications. This paper takes a social action standpoint for the purposeful identification and organisation of collaborative design activities; proposes guidelines at multiple levels of abstraction for the design of VECD; and, finally, applies these to a case study development of a specific VECD for interior space design. The paper provides practical aids to designers of VECD so that they incorporate requirements about collaborative design early in the development lifecycle.""Experience reflection modelling (ERM) as a design research method emerges out of participatory and generative research approaches. It includes tools and techniques that are put together strategically to enable the involvement of people in the early stages of the design process, connecting students and people by creating an effective medium for the knowledge transfer. In design education, ERM focuses on bridging the gap between the early stages of the design process and idea generation by providing students with techniques for revealing user knowledge, and encouraging them to combine design and user knowledge in the development of design solutions. This paper presents the ERM method, and explains its implications for an educational project and a field study. The intention in the study is to gain insights into ERM and to obtain students’ reflections so as to develop it in such a way that it enriches student engagement. The study explores the motives and obstacles for each of the ERM phases; the factors affecting student engagement during their use of the method; its implications for idea generation; and the design students’ intentions to use ERM in future design practice. The paper concludes with the suggestions and insights for ERM’s further development.""This paper provides a critical appraisal of methods for analysing the quality of collaboration in design meetings. After a discussion of how effective collaboration can be related to successful design, some existing approaches to evaluating the quality of collaboration are reviewed, and one specific method for analysing and evaluating socio-cognitive processes involved in design meetings is presented in some detail, together with its strengths and weaknesses. The concluding discussion aims to deepen and extend previous methods, with a view to outlining future research perspectives. The need for taking into account the additional dimension of the dynamics of interpersonal relations, involving the mutual regulation of tensions and affects, is discussed. It is argued that there is no privileged standpoint from which to evaluate the quality of collaboration: the qualities to which precedence will be given depend on the objects of co-design activities, what is at stake, and the alternative viewpoints of social actors involved, including researchers. The problem of articulating multiple views of the quality of collaboration is discussed.""For more than four decades, participatory design has provided exemplars and concepts for understanding the democratic potential of design participation. Despite important impacts on design methodology, participatory design has, however, been stuck in a marginal position as it has wrestled with what has been performed and accomplished in participatory practices. In this article, we discuss how participatory design may be reinvigorated as a design research programme for democratic design experiments in the light of the decentring of human-centredness and the foregrounding of collaborative representational practices offered by the ANT tradition in the tension between a parliament of things and a laboratory of circulating references.""Teacher and student interaction in a design studio setting has always been the basis of design education. A fundamental difficulty of design education is that the content of these one-on-one meetings between teacher and students remains remarkably implicit. In this paper, we present an explorative study that uses the design grammar model (DGM) as an observational framework for teacher–student interactions. The DGM is rooted on the concept of design grammar that can be broadly defined as the visual language used to design. The study focuses on the industrial design junior students’ meetings with their teacher; our research proceeds from a protocol analysis of the transcripts that are coded according to the DGM. The resulting data are then used to develop a series of diagrams that are employed as a visual analysis tool. The diagrams synthesise and convey large amounts of data that permit immediate analysis and elicit new interpretations. The study resulted in encouraging results regarding the DGM’s potential as an analysis tool for teacher and student interactions, as well as a diagnostic tool for teachers.""This article shares outcomes from a year-long participatory planning process – one that brought together children and youth engagement, city planning, campus planning, and a university environmental design course to explore child-friendly, dense and affordable housing for a city of approximately 100,000 residents. This process of engagement asked design students to include youth participation and child-friendly cities as an integrated component of sustainable cities. The article shows varying degrees of transformation, views of children as credible participants, and values gained from the project. Many undergraduates changed their thinking about the role of young people in design processes and outcomes.""Complexity in collaborative design has technical as well as social aspects. Design team members must learn to manage the technical interdependencies between design tasks, as well as the social processes related to construction and maintenance of design teams. Such activities tend to require constant communication and coordination. One promising approach to team communication and coordination involves use of peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies. Collaboration technologies, or groupware, enable construction of online social groups in which specialised types of information can be exchanged. P2P-based groupware allows design team members to acquire relevant local perspectives from their collaborators in a distributed, non-prescriptive fashion. A P2P approach to design communication and coordination is discussed in relation to theories on structuration, which similarly address issues related to local action and emergent social structure.""This paper explores how the roles or social categories ‘architect’ and ‘client’ are performed by participants as they meet to talk about the design of a crematorium. The analytic framework through which the interaction is studied is Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA). By attending to the participants' talk through the perspectives of MCA, we can see how questions and answers, attributions of building ownership, and assessments of the building are enacted in ways that enable the participants to competently perform as ‘architect’ and ‘client’. Thus, as well as the participants' interaction helping to shape the actual form of the building, it also helps to shape and perpetuate ideas concerning what it is to ‘do’ architecture.""In user-centered design, attention has shifted from improving usability and addressing ergonomic problems to wider perspectives such as experiences in everyday life. This shift has forced user-centered practitioners to evaluate and develop tools for finding new means of understanding user experience for design. Visual, playful and open-ended probes have raised fresh interest in the design community. In order to create a deeper understanding of this approach, this paper presents the fundamental qualities of probes and, based on empirical data and literature, describes four reasons for applying them in the product development and concept design context: for inspiration, for information, for participation and for dialogue.""Designs do not occur in a vacuum. They are nourished by a breeding ground composed of various substances, phenomena and traces, which function as raw material for concept generation and ultimately for design. This paper examines the composition and function of this ‘culture medium’ in the context of design education through reporting two content-wise connected studies: a series of in-depth interviews with experienced design tutors, and an ethnographically oriented study with design students. Combining and comparing information gathered in both studies reveals some interesting insights about what ‘culture media’ are valued by tutors and students.""Autistic adults with limited speech and additional learning disabilities who are often excluded from design research are at the heart of this project. These are people whose perceptions, experiences and interactions with their surroundings are unique, but also are people who may not be able to communicate verbally their differences to the remaining 99% of the population. This, in combination with their distinctive cognitive profile, has resulted in a lack of studies involving people living with autism, and consequently their life experiences may neither be heard nor understood and remain largely unexplored. By reflecting upon the ongoing design collaboration between The Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design and the autism charity The Kingwood Trust, this paper reflects on the approach and methods used in three design studies. Particular attention is paid towards the careful selection, adaptation and development of collaborative design methods for autistic adults and their support staff to be involved. By working beyond the boundaries of a neurotypical culture, the project aims to support the greater goal of improving the everyday experiences of people living with autism by breaking down the barriers to participation.""Recent studies have shown that there is a need to improve usability-related decision-making in product development teams to prevent usability problems in the final product. Those decisions are heavily influenced by the knowledge those teams have of future use situations and expected usability issues. Our previous research showed that design team members often implicitly hold this type of knowledge, but do not share it within the team. This lack of a shared understanding of product use negatively influences the decision-making process. In this paper we present the iterative development of a set of guidelines to support design teams in sharing knowledge of product use through the generation of flexible, explicit and evolving frames of reference. A series of studies in which the guidelines were evaluated suggest that particularly the activity of collaboratively creating the explicit frame of reference contributes to a shared understanding of product use.""This paper describes a comparative study, which explores the influence of different sources of information on design sessions aiming for product concepts for children with autism. Six design teams were informed about children with autism under three conditions: A teams had only background information, B teams had background information and direct contact, and C teams had background information plus a video. Each team conducted a design session resulting in one product concept. These sessions were videotaped, transcribed and analysed for signs of empathy. The proposed product concepts were evaluated by parents and teachers of the children. Results show that the two B teams discussed the user group most intensively, and produced concepts that fitted the user group best. The two A teams made many false assumptions about the user group. One C team discussed the user group intensively and produced a product concept appreciated by caregivers, while the other C team did the opposite. The latter team was not motivated for the session. The results indicate that, and show examples of how, direct contact brings empathy with users to design teams and positively influences the quality of the product concepts they produce. Willingness and motivation of designers are key factors in empathic design.""During the past five years design has been recognised as a powerful innovation driver. Design methods and tools have also been applied in new fields. One of them is social innovation, which is aimed at developing new ideas and solutions in response to social needs. While different initiatives have demonstrated how design can be a powerful approach in social innovation, especially when it comes to systemic thinking, prototyping and visualising, some concerns have been raised regarding the limitations of applying design in this field. Through a specific case, this paper will discuss and suggest some approaches and concepts related to design for social innovation. Coming from a participatory design tradition, we focus on the idea of infrastructuring as a way to approach social innovation that differs from project-based design. The activities that are carried out are aimed at building long-term relationships with stakeholders in order to create networks from which design opportunities can emerge. We also discuss the role of prototyping as a way to explore opportunities but we also highlight dilemmas.""In this paper we discuss one practice of social design and social innovation by which designers and participants work together to reveal the factors, relations and consequences of an issue. We refer to this as the collective articulation of issues. Within the context of social design and social innovation the articulation of issues takes on a distinctive character and can be manifested through a wider range of design engagements than previously considered. To support our discussion we analyse two design engagements from the growBot Garden project, a research project exploring technologies for small-scale agriculture. Through this analysis we identify the qualities of the event and pluralism as central to the collective articulation of issues. We argue that the collective articulation of issues is a foundational practice of social design and social innovation, comprising an outcome and purpose in its own right.""Methods used to engage users in the design process often rely on visual techniques, such as paper prototypes, to facilitate the expression and communication of design ideas. The visual nature of these tools makes them inaccessible to people living with visual impairments. In addition, while using visual means to express ideas for designing graphical interfaces is appropriate, it is harder to use them to articulate the design of non-visual displays. In this article, we present an approach to conducting participatory design with people living with visual impairments incorporating various techniques to help make the design process accessible. We reflect on the benefits and challenges that we encountered when employing these techniques in the context of designing cross-modal interactive tools.""This article presents and discusses co-creation techniques for involving children in the design of a technologically enhanced learning environment. The ECHOES project, which involves both typically developing children and children with autism spectrum conditions, aims to create an environment that scaffolds the development of children's social skills. The authors draw attention to the constraints and limitations of co-designing new technologies, which are by necessity interdisciplinary, and describe experiments with sensory interest and storytelling to bridge tensions between system design and the imaginary worlds of young children. Related work is reviewed, where children with special needs have been included in the design process, and a series of design activities implemented in ECHOES is described. Reflecting on these experiences, key themes are identified that may be of interest to practitioners and researchers who work with children in inclusive design contexts. These themes address the role of theory, the impact of technology, the support of creativity, the validity of inspiration and the design of non-digital generative tools to harness children's imagination. The article also includes a discussion on the ethical implications of co-designing with children and describes how the project evolved as a consequence of the work described.""This paper examines the need for large-scale, sustainable changes, and the effects of citizens' active participation and design co-operating to realise such changes.Section 1, starting from Pelle Ehn's last contribution, deals with participatory designand how it can be extended from the traditional idea of participation as the integration of users in projects, to the concept of participation as the interaction of active groups of citizens with open and articulated processes in the direction of socio-technical changes. Section 2 introduces the idea of planning by projects strategyand presents five design projects. Section 3 discusses how participatory design can be extended to give a rationale for these large-scale projects and what designers did in practice: triggered citizens’ interest, aligned their motivations and empowered their capabilities. The idea emerging from this discussion is that when participatory design is intended as an approach aiming at broad and complex transformation processes its traditional notion must integrate the concept of social innovation (first step) and evolve towards the idea of an open process where a multiplicity of small, diverse, participated initiatives (or local projects) interact (second step) to achieve a larger vision.""Making use of insights gained through field research in design can be challenging. Some issues that design teams may face are making sense of fragmented data collected, sharing insight among the design team and presenting the data in ways that support the situated design work. This paper introduces layered scenario mapping, a technique aimed at meeting such issues when designing a ship’s bridge. The technique builds on and expands traditional techniques for representing user data in design and results in a map describing a typical scenario along several dimensions and at different levels of abstraction. It highlights the spatial and temporal aspects of the situation, and emphasises the use of visual presentations. This paper describes why and how the layered scenario mapping technique was created, it critically assesses the technique and discusses experiences with using it. The technique proved to be valuable in making sense of fragmented data, and supported the design team’s collaborative work when designing a ship’s bridge. It is expected that the technique can also prove valuable when designing for other contexts where the spatial and/or temporal dimensions are of importance.""User-centred design is a widely acknowledged practice. Much attention has been paid to the methods, tools and processes on how to conduct design research and field studies with and about ‘users’ and existing or possible ‘contexts of use’. The underlying driver is that the design team will be better at designing if they have an empathic understanding of the people to design with and for. Currently, more effort is invested in engaging various stakeholders in collaborative design activities that nurture an attitude of human-centredness as a strategy. Empathic design approaches are essential in such strategies as they value subjective and experiential perspectives in design. The objective of this paper is to illustrate and discuss different kinds of formats that can be used to work with representations of field research findings and insights in ways that can be open-ended. Being open-ended means that they can allow and inspire new individual interpretations for various participants in the collaborative design processes, which include users, designers and other stakeholders. What is argued for here is the value of incompleteness of field study outcomes as it invites sense-making through making new interpretations which lead to empathic understanding and engagement. Rather than communicating the final results, design in supporting collaboration is applied in a process of exploring what it is that will create value for specific people.""The UK government is investing approximately £21.9 billion in the refurbishment or rebuilding of all secondary schools by 2021 under the Building Schools for the Future programme. One of the requirements of the scheme is student participation; however, little guidance is offered as to the form this participation should take. This paper will describe and evaluate the methods adopted by one secondary school to engage students in the design process. The approaches include a ‘Design your School’ conference, the utilisation of the Personal, Social and Health Education curriculum and accessing student voice through school councils. The research was conducted as part of an Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded project ‘Realising participatory design with children and young people: a case study of design and refurbishment in schools’.""In recent years, various critiques of participative approaches to design processes have been presented. Participatory urban planning has been subject to a specific form of criticism, which posits that such processes are ‘post-political’, inasmuch as they merely legitimise the power and political agendas of elites. In reviewing a case of participatory urban planning in Gothenburg, Sweden, this article suggests that actor-network theory can be operationalised as an alternative means to account for democratic deficiencies of co-design practices. It thus uses the concept of translation to describe how the original interests of participants may be betrayed, as successive translations cause objectives to drift. It also suggests that the key agency in these unfortunate betrayals is not human, but emerges through the material modes of collaboration. The article thus endeavours to contribute to the debate on how co-design processes may become more effective means to democratise urban planning and design.""Interactive art is said to be ‘created’ by the people engaged in the active experience of it. Works are conceived and first tried out in the studio environment by the artist and then introduced to a wider audience whose behaviour influences its particular visual and auditory manifestations. Research into this kind of process presents interesting challenges that require interdisciplinary collaboration. Artists, technologists, curators, museum organizers are seeking new ways to understand what is effective and engaging about the interactive experience. The practice-led research process is one of co-evolution between creative acts and research knowledge drawn from both informal experiences and organized studies. The present paper describes practice-led strategies for research that have been developed at the Creativity and Cognition Studios and put into effect in Beta_space, an exhibiting space in a major public museum.""How a design concept was interactionally produced in the talk-in-interaction between an architect and client representatives was studied. The empirical analysis was informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to observe structures and patterns of talk that accomplished actions and practices of design. Some differences were observed between the properties of the design concept in comparison with the design ideas that were considered during these conversations. The design concept was observed to be significant for assessing why some moves in a design space were considered better than others. The importance of the design concept to these interactions raised more general questions about what a design concept is and how it can be described as an object type. With reference to studies of science, technology and society these concerns were provisionally engaged with and further study of the object properties of design concepts is suggested.""Sir John Egan's 1998 report on the construction industry (Construction Task Force 1998) noted its confrontational and adversarial nature. Both the original report and its subsequent endorsement in Accelerating Change (Strategic Forum 2002) called for improved working relationships—so-called ‘integration’—within and between both design and construction aspects. In this paper, we report on our observations of on-site team meetings for a major UK project during its construction phase. We attended a series of team meetings and recorded the patterns of verbal interaction that took place within them. In reporting our findings, we have deliberately used a graphical method for presenting the results, in the expectation that this will make them more readily accessible to designers. Our diagrams of these interaction patterns have already proved to be intuitively and quickly understood, and have generated interest and discussion among both those we observed and others who have seen them. We noted that different patterns of communication occurred in different types of meetings. Specifically, in the problem-solving meeting, there was a richness of interaction that was largely missing from progress meetings and technical meetings. Team members expressed greater satisfaction with this problem-solving meeting where these enriched exchanges took place. By making comparisons between the different patterns, we are also able to explore functional roles and their interactions. From this and other published evidence, we conclude that good teamworking practices depend on a complex interplay of relations and dependencies embedded within the team.""In recent years, various methods and techniques have emerged for mapping the contexts of people's interaction with products. Designers and researchers use these techniques to gain deeper insight into the needs and dreams of prospective users of new products. As most of these techniques are still under development, there is a lack of practical knowledge about how such studies can be conducted. In this paper we share our insights, based on several projects from research and many years of industrial practice, of conducting user studies with generative techniques. The appendix contains a single case illustrating the application of these techniques in detail.""Design researchers have an important role to play when engaged with user-driven design projects in industry. Design researchers can craft ethnographic material to facilitate transfers of user-knowledge to industry, and demonstrate how this material can be used in the design of new products and services. However, ethnographic findings can reveal issues that are in tension with conceptions of the project members from industry. Instead of brushing these tensions aside, we propose provotyping (provocative prototyping) as an approach to constructively build on them as a resource for change. Provotypes are ethnographically rooted, technically working, robust artefacts that deliberately challenge stakeholder conceptions by reifying and exposing tensions that surround a field of organisational interest. The daily and local experience of provotypes aims to stir dialectical processes of reflection on how conceptions currently are, and fuel the front end of a development process by speculating how conceptions could be different. In this article we start by making explicit the relation between provotypes, practices of critical design and organisational sense-making. We then illustrate, through a multi-stakeholder project concerning the field of indoor climate, how provotypes facilitate transfers of user knowledge to industry, and how they contribute to the development of new products and services. We end by framing the role of the design researcher and discuss the politics that are inherent to design provocations.""Improving co-design methods implies that we need to understand those methods, paying attention to not only the effect of method choices on design outcomes, but also how methods affect the people involved in co-design. In this article, we explore participants' experiences from a year-long participatory health service design project to develop ‘Better Outpatient Services for Older People’. The project followed a defined method called experience-based design (EBD), which represented the state of the art in participatory service design within the UK National Health Service. A sample of participants in the project took part in semi-structured interviews reflecting on their involvement in and their feelings about the project. Our findings suggest that the EBD method that we employed was successful in establishing positive working relationships among the different groups of stakeholders (staff, patients, carers, advocates and design researchers), although conflicts remained throughout the project. Participants' experiences highlighted issues of wider relevance in such participatory design: cost versus benefit, sense of project momentum, locus of control, and assumptions about how change takes place in a complex environment. We propose tactics for dealing with these issues that inform the future development of techniques in user-centred healthcare design.""Children are usually more competent than acknowledged by adults and designers. Valuable user perspectives are lost if only information from adult carers such as teachers and parents is included in the design process. Participatory projects can be empowering processes resulting in empowered outcomes, i.e. increased physical empowerment of children and products that raise their quality of life. In this paper, a theoretical platform for developing a design methodology for participatory design with underprivileged children in developing countries is presented. The framework consists of an explanation of psychological empowerment in the context of participatory design processes, a definition of participatory design with children, and a model distinguishing between different levels of user participation. Experiences and results from a case study conducted with children using prosthetic legs in Cambodia are described. The case study shows that through simple participatory techniques, children can give designers insight into their needs and desires.""Interactivity has proved a successful way to engage visitors of science museums. However, it is not a common practice when the objects to exhibit are artefacts or, as in the case of this paper, books. A study was set up to investigate the driving criteria for the ‘The Life and Work of William Butler Yeats’ exhibition at the National Library of Ireland and compare those with the visitors’ opinions. Books, notebooks and personal belongings of the poet have been digitized and used to create a rich and varied exhibition that used both interactivity and multimedia. The result of a visitors' survey showed that the variety was a key factor for the success of the exhibition: different people engaged with different contents and different medium to different degrees. The design of the ambience is critical: dim lights and the use of audio as a medium have to be carefully planned to avoid annoying instead of engaging.""Undergraduate digital media design education is linked to a professional or vocational model, given that students are typically focused on the industry and its employment opportunities. Introducing authentic real-life scenarios in digital media design education is an effective strategy to replicate industry and the profession in order to prepare students for a successful transition from the classroom to their future multidisciplinary collaborative work environment. Linking industry and education in the scenario allows students to explore workplace issues and interact with practitioners, enabling them to understand the realities and complexities associated with multidisciplinary teamwork within the sector in which they will work. This article overviews the design of a real-life scenario to foster collaborative learning for digital media design and information technology students. Key findings include the fact that the majority of students indicated a future preference to work on real-world projects, they found the integrated feedback from an industry professional helpful, and more complex projects of a higher standard were completed. Students also experienced ‘authentic’ challenges during the collaborative process (e.g. communication challenges) and which reflect those of industry. The study also revealed that the introduction of multidisciplinary teams leads to a more enriched learning environment for all participating students.""Codesign with people living with cognitive or sensory impairments poses challenges for researchers and designers, due to differences in their mutual experiences and due to the fact that many well-established codesign methods and techniques may not be appropriate and need adjustment. This paper describes a search for an appropriate, dedicated methodological approach for involving people living with impairments in codesign projects. Based on both existing literature and on a series of three academic workshops, we aimed to understand how researchers and designers adjust common codesign techniques and to derive general principles from those adjustments. During our search for a dedicated codesign approach, however, we came to change our view, and therefore our aims. The outcomes of the workshops, more specifically the identification of common challenges that researchers and designers experience, showed that such a dedicated approach may not be the best way to advance the field of codesign methods for people living with impairments. Instead, we now advocate a highly individual approach towards adjusting codesign techniques. In addition, we suggest a new tradition of sharing experiences in order for researchers and designers to learn from one another in the form of method stories.""In this paper, we investigate the stances that designers take in relation to one another in design critiques. Analysis of audiovisual recordings of critiques between students and professional designers in industrial design in the DTRS 10 data-set reveals that design concepts not only are verbally narrated but also come to life in gesture, gaze, orientation and body movement. In these bodily performances, participants adopt and shift between several identified stances, which we callinscriptional, third-person, first-person and phenomenal. In social relations, these stances are mirrored, taken up, responded to and elaborated by the other participants. The critique itself, then, can be seen as a dialogical movement by the participating designers through a set of stances. By comparing a case in which participants are collocated to a case in which the participants are at a geographic distance facilitated only by real-time audio and shared computer display, we conjecture that this responsive mirroring and elaboration of stance can be hindered when participants do not have visual access to one another and thus increase the chances of communication breakdowns.""Co-designing is an activity based on emergence where constituents are mutually changing towards purposeful outcomes. Here, I draw on the Japanese philosophy ofMa as ‘between-ness’ to explore how we are transforming and becoming togetheramong this heterogeneity. Yet, if emergence of potentiality is hard to articulate, it is even harder to understand. As we design, we are embedded within and inscripted by conditions that we cannot quite touch or see visibly, yet manifests through its evolution. Awakening to this in-between presence is a necessary start because co-designing is performed and emerges from relational sensitivity. Here, I entangle Mawith actor-network theory (ANT) to orient our senses towards that which have yet assembled or actioned. Latour describes these as empty spaces of a network, void and ‘plasma’ that also has agency. If ANT primarily helps us see the flow of actions among being and non-beings, Ma as between-ness can re-situate us in emergence and contingency. Seen this way, co-designing can be ways to bring others along on this journey of uncertainty in a pursuit to create ‘empty’ in-betweens within and among ourselves as we mutually become together through inter-relatedness.""Living laboratories are increasingly common and promising arrangements in collaborative design. Their strength lies in being real life, open ended, sustained and complex coproduction arrangements, but these characteristics also make it hard to research what difference a living lab collaboration would make – after all the project within a living lab should be quite different to one conducted without it. This paper reports on a rare opportunity to compare two unusually similar innovation projects, one of which relied on a living lab and the other that did not. Contrary to what one might have predicted, the living lab collaboration did not make the development paths very different, and the key challenges regarding design collaboration remained closely similar. Extensive redesign in pilot use, an extended learning period between developers and users, consciously built collaboration arrangements, effective boundary spanners and investment in conflict resolution were equally paramount to success in both cases. The living laboratory did make meeting these challenges quicker, and lessened the strain that redesigns caused to customer relations.""Over the last decade, an array of policy interventions relating to children, young people and education in the UK have positioned pupil participation in the (re)design of school environments as a key imperative. Indeed, pupil participation is an explicit, core ideal of major, ongoing school (re)construction and (re)design programmes in the UK such as Building Schools for the Future, Academy schools, and Primary Capital Funding. The aim of this paper is to juxtapose the ideals of participation as expressed in national policy statements, via-à-vis the ways in which participation in these contexts is being done (or not) in practice. To this end, the paper presents findings from in-depth interviews with Local Authority officers responsible for the implementation of policies relating to school (re)building and (re)design in diverse localities. These interviews show how the idea(l) of pupil participation may, in practice, be foreclosed by contingencies, budgets, issues, debates, personalities and events at grassroots level. The paper will suggest that national policy-making regarding participation should be better grounded in the complex and diverse realities of the (re)design of school environments in practice.""This paper discusses the connection between team mental models (TMM) in creative teams and in operational teams. It focuses on the transition from explorative design activities to exploitative manufacturing activities and discusses the notion of TMM as means and ends to arrive at volume production of the new product. In reaction to the introductory paper four comments are made: (1) a specific transition model should be added, which contains knowledge, abilities and attitudes that are prerequisite to boundary spanning team activities, (2) an external party (e.g. client, user) with a distinct mental model should be included in the research setup, (3) the division of sub-mental models should be conceptualized at a more general level in order to form a base for a coherent ontology of TMM, and (4) we need to be realistic about the value of the notion TMM, as their main purpose is to aid research and communication about research.""This paper concerns social learning modes and their effects on team performance. Social learning, such as by observing others' actions and their outcomes, allows members of a team to learn what other members know. Knowing what other members know can reduce task communication and co-ordination overhead, which helps the team to perform faster since members can devote their attention to their tasks. This paper describes agent-based simulation studies using a computational model that implements different social learning modes as parameters that can be controlled in the simulations. The results show that social learning from both direct and indirect observations positively contributes to learning about what others know, but the value of social learning is sensitive to prior familiarity such that minimum thresholds of team familiarity are needed to realise the benefits of social learning. This threshold increases with task complexity. These findings clarify the level of influence that sociality has on social learning and sets up a formal framework by which to conduct studies on how social context influences learning and group performance.""The importance of values in design work is gaining increasing attention. However, some of the work to date takes an approach which starts with generic values, or assumes values are constant. Through discussion of three accounts of value discovery and value evolution in projects focused on exploring novel uses of ubiquitous computing, we complement current thinking by arguing for the use of users' values as a resource in the co-design process. In particular, this paper shows how users' values: (a) are spontaneously expressed whether or not particular elicitation methods are used; (b) are not fixed, but can change dynamically during the co-design process in response to ideas, prototypes and demonstrators; (c) help mediate and shape the relationships of users to designers; (d) can support users' creative, functional and technical engagement in co-design – areas that can often prove difficult. Focusing on practical examples that demonstrate this approach, we conclude that values may act as a central resource for co-design in a larger variety of ways than has hitherto been recognised.""In this paper we discuss how geographical notions of space and place can aid designers in creating meaningful interactions between end users and technologically augmented physical spaces—specifically museums. We review the literature that discusses the use of spatial concepts and metaphors within the interaction design field and discuss several examples of interactive museum installations. We then describe how we have incorporated our understanding of place and human experience into the design and development of a hybrid museum space: an interactive exhibition entitled ‘Re-Tracing the Past’ at the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland.""This paper reports research conducted in collaboration with the Hunt Museum, Limerick, Ireland, which examined how children's interaction in museums could be augmented through co-operative design. The paper describes the participatory design process that was undertaken over a two-year period, involving key informants and stakeholders, including teachers, docents (specialist museum guides) and curators. The designers also explored the potential of ubiquitous computing to enhance children's interpretive experience in museums, and this is also described. The research reported in this paper was supported within the EU disappearing computer (DC) initiative, specifically the SHAPE project. The goal of SHAPE, Situating Hybrid Assemblies in Public Environments, was to explore how emerging, novel computer technologies could be deployed in public spaces to enhance interaction and learning. The project culminated in the deployment of an innovative, large-scale computer-augmented exhibition, Re-Tracing the Past, in the Hunt Museum. This novel exhibition was open to the public from 9 to 19 June 2003. This paper documents the design process from initial scenario elaboration through to final deployment of novel technology in the museum. Evaluation data are also discussed, and the paper concludes with some insights for participatory design of technology to enhance children's interaction in museums. Furthermore, the review of evaluation data illustrates how the design themes that informed the extensive design process were successfully embodied in the final exhibition in the museum.""This paper reports a design research case on mobile learning technology for children and teenagers living with the chronic illness diabetes. A central focus in the design process was to understand the young people's perspective on their chronic illness and on mobile technology support. Towards this end, a design workshop was facilitated to promote the articulation of their emotions towards design. This presentation outlines this design activity and discusses the results of 12 mock-ups created by a group of young people living with diabetes. The analysis and reflections of the user mock-ups highlight three aspects related to their identity of self, the burden of being young with a chronic illness, and the need to feel connected and safe in a society generally unaware of or uninformed about their illness.""This article presents an approach to aggregation of stakeholders' feedback-through-demonstration as of the earliest phase of software development. We demonstrate operational software concepts to a multiplicity of stakeholders, using a novel methodology for modular abstract prototyping (MAP). MAP combines generic and specific modules according to stakeholder focus, i.e. according to their viewpoints, demands, skills and presentation modality. A module captures and demonstrates a specific part or aspect of the functional and behavioural application content. As a result, generic plus specific modules implement the complete demonstration of the software concept as a real-life process. Multiple module configurations can be generated to demonstrate the software concept to the various stakeholder groups in multiple sessions. This article presents the theory and implementation principle of MAP, and illustrates this with an application example on a software tool for smart energy saving. Focus group assessments confirmed a significantly improved convergence among stakeholders and developers at the early stages of development. However, the current MAP is still labour intensive and further automation is desirable. Considering today's pervasive and intense conceptual design and product innovation processes dynamics, MAP is to become a first step towards fully interactive modifiable medium-fidelity abstract prototyping.""The successful implementation of brand values and emotional concepts into physical products is critical in the design process of branded products and can be problematic when multidisciplinary project teams come from different backgrounds. This paper argues that lack of communication between product designers and engineering designers causes additional process iterations to assure that the initially intended brand values and emotional responses are preserved in the final product. This paper investigates the use of Annotations, Word Mappings and Multiple-Domain Matrices as three potential approaches to support the communication between product designers and engineering designers. The results of an evaluation study show the level of acceptability of these approaches among product designers, engineering designers and academics depending on the purpose of its use, the familiarity of users with the representation and the stage of the design process.""Participatory Action Research (PAR) has a long history of use with disadvantaged groups in order to assist them to improve their living conditions, however its use with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects is less well known. This paper examines a case study where PAR was tied with the use of a technology probe by an Aboriginal group, with the goal of determining if culturally appropriate design of ICTs could help support individual well-being. The results of this project show that although PAR and probes can be used together, this combination has the potential to alter how probes are traditionally used in the design space. To support this premise, we review the history of the probes method in the literature and discuss changes in how cultural and technology probes have been implemented in recent years. We argue that as modifications are made to these frameworks due to the needs of the research, two sorts of project results should be fully elucidated: (1) the changes made to the original methodology and (2) how these changes have had an effect on the real-life environment to which they were applied.""The aim of this paper is to explore the role of joint remembering in collaborative design. Joint remembering sequences are identified on the basis of questions that act as triggers to specific interactive sequences. The sequences are situated in the ongoing collaborative design process, and empirical evidence is provided that illustrates how the interweaving of verbal, bodily, social and material resources supports joint remembering. Three examples of joint remembering sequences in co-design are analysed from a corpus of interactions (45+ hours of audio and video recording), collected during an observational study of a team of four 3D designers working on a TV commercial. This study suggests that questions acting as reminders foster the formation of multimodal remembering sequences (MRSs) that connect multiple timescales over the duration of co-design projects. In the corpus under study, MRSs enable designers to plan future actions and make decisions on the fly.""The role of making in the design process has been growing, taking on new forms and involving new players over the past 10 years. Where we once primarily saw designers using making to give shape to the future, today we can see designers and non-designers working together, using making as a way to make sense of the future. In this paper, we describe the landscape of design research and practice at the end of 2013 with special attention to the role of making across these perspectives: approach (cultural probes, generative toolkits and design prototypes), mindset (designing for people and designing with people), focus in time (the world as it is, the near future and the speculative future) as well as variations in design intent (provoking, engaging and serving).""Increasing efforts have been made to engage children in the design of the built environment, and several participatory models have been developed. The aim of this paper is to propose a pedagogical model for children's genuine participation in architectural design, developed in an architectural education context. According to this pedagogical model, children (primary school students) and youth (university architecture students) work in teams to develop the architectural design proposals. This model was developed through a joint educational project between Deakin University and Wales Street Primary School (both institutions are based in Victoria, Australia). In the four-week duration of the project, first year architecture students worked with Grade 3 and 4 primary school children to design a school playground. The final product of the project was a 1:20 scale model of a playground, which was installed and presented at the end of the fourth week. The project received positive feedback from all the participants, including children, architecture students, university lecturers, primary school teachers and architects. In addition, it achieved a high level of children's genuine participation. This model can be refined and applied in new situations, and potentially with other primary schools working with Deakin University.""The purpose of the present study was to analyze the differences and effects of user participation in university level students' collaborative design processes. The study focused on how intended users (i.e., frequent conference-goers) participated in a product design process (designing conference bags) and how much influence these conference-goers had on students' design solutions. The data were derived from a collaborative learning environment (Future Learning Environment, FLE2), which provided a distributed database for students' and users' dialogue. The study employed qualitative content analysis of users' written messages posted on the database. The analysis indicated users' contributions to the functional, expressive and aesthetic design solutions. From the students' standpoint, it was challenging to treat contradictory information produced by users and to find optimal design solutions.""When we stage participatory prototyping, we arrange constraints and possibilities and envision a place of co-creation for designers and users. We argue that the activity of participatory prototyping can benefit from unfolding in imaginative places that are radically distant from the places of current practice. Our work with participatory prototyping indicates that a radicalisation towards an imaginative place of co-creation provides participants with an extended space for imagining future practices. Departing from the Scandinavian participatory prototyping heritage, our research is an inquiry into staging the places of participatory prototyping. Staging imaginative places is carried out by a careful selection and coordination of anchoring elements that maintain references to current practice andelements of transcendence that afford the imaginative place. As such, we supplement the qualities of the prototype and the process of prototyping with a concern for the place in which prototyping unfolds. We present two cases of participatory prototyping sessions that outline our work with staging imaginative places for participatory prototyping.""This paper provides an overview of a project-based graduate course on the Design of Interactive Media for Public Spaces, which is part of a Masters programme of study in Interactive Media. Project teams make use of a variety of design methods over the 14-week course: students work through a complete design life-cycle using a combination of methods from observational studies through to concept design, prototyping, testing and evaluation. This paper outlines the structure of the course and illustrates two examples of projects completed by student teams. The paper shows how it is possible in a short time-frame to have students undertake a real-world-based design project, bringing it to the stage of preliminary prototype design. It emphasizes the importance of using a combination of methods, and of supporting students' reflections on their design practice and experiences during the project.""In this paper we present Fictional Inquiry, a collaborative Participatory Design technique that provides an approach that allows designers to shape the context of collaborative design activities. Fictional Inquiry allows designers to address specific issues when inquiring into existing use practices, or exploring the future in the collaborative design process. Fictional Inquiry entails bypassing existing socio-cultural structures by creating partially fictional situations, artifacts, and narratives that mediate collaborative design activities. In this paper we present the Fictional Inquiry technique through three cases that highlight the applicability of the technique when staging the design situation, evoking ideas for possible futures, and initiating organizational change. We present a general framework for understanding and staging Fictional Inquiry, and provide an account of how Fictional Inquiry was used in three quite different design situations.""People on the autistic spectrum are characterised as having difficulties with social and communicative functioning. They are understood to have unusual sensory experiences, in any modality, which means that their perception of the world is alarmingly different from non-autistic people. These experiences create confusion and anxiety, and for many autistic individuals their lives are dominated by fear.A body of research exists, however, to suggest that computers present an ideal medium for reducing the confusing, multi-sensory distractions of the real world and that given the right approach, there is a strong possibility that some aspects of computation could prove relaxing and therapeutic.This paper will document the participatory design and development methods of the ReacTickles© software, which, by encouraging exploration and experimentation from a simple, structured interface, aims to promote relaxation, encourage spontaneous play, and support learning for children on the autistic spectrum.The paper will reveal how the entire design process from concept development through to the varied and flexible evaluation strategies, has been informed by the distinct needs and characteristics of the target population.""Brands undeniably constitute a significant asset for a company and are usually specified in its organisational strategy. Typically, employees are not invited to participate in debates or decisions about branding since they access brand information in a unidirectional way. Many of them do not even know how to convey appropriate messages and fail to recognise the importance of brand consistency. In this article we propose a heuristic for an interaction structure aimed at brand artefact co-design, through a computer-mediated platform, so that employees may learn about the brand, develop brand knowledge, propose meaningful brand artefacts and manage the evaluation of their peers’ proposals. We prepared a non-functional prototype of a Participatory Brand Centre and tested it in focus group sessions with the University of Aveiro's employees. We found that though our proposal is consistent with employees’ brand-related needs, authorship is a sensitive issue.""The notion of laboratory or simply ‘lab’ has become popular in recent years in areas outside science and technology development. Learning Labs, Innovation Labs, Usability Labs, Media and Communication Labs and even Art Labs designate institutions or fora dedicated to change and experimentation. Influenced by these currents, we use the expression ‘Design:Lab’ as a shorthand description of open collaborations between many stakeholders sharing a mutual interest in design research in a particular field. Many have reacted to the term ‘laboratory’ or ‘lab’ as foreign and awkward to design, and we as well as others have frequently used other metaphors like workshop, studio or atelier in design research. In this article we will argue that the laboratory metaphor is particularly suitable and useful for the Design:Lab, and we will give examples of how we have worked with the Design:Lab as a platform for collaborative inquiries and knowledge production based on design experiments.""Since the advent of participatory design in the work democracy projects of the 1970s and 1980s in Scandinavia, computing technology and people's engagement with it have undergone fundamental changes. Although participatory design continues to be a precondition for designing computing that aligns with human practices, the motivations to engage in participatory design have changed, and the new era requires formats that are different from the original ones. Through the analysis of three case studies, this paper seeks to explain why participatory design must be brought to bear on the field of ubiquitous computing, and how this challenges the original participatory design thinking. In particular, we will argue that more casual, exploratory formats of engagement with people are required, and rather than planning the all-encompassing systems development project, participatory design needs to move towards iterative, experimental design explorations to provide necessary understanding of today's complex contexts and practices. We argue that there does not need to be a discrepancy between the ideals of empowering people with new technology, and the understanding of customer value in a business perspective.""The paper discusses aspects of digital art from the point of view of the notion of observable human – computer interaction. The use of the word interaction is reviewed and alternative approaches to describing the concept explored. In particular, a systems view is taken and contrasted with an action/response model. A refined view of such interactions is proposed in which artwork and audience are said to influence one another.""A carer or teacher often plays the role of proxy or spokesperson for a person living with an intellectual disability or form of cognitive or sensory impairment. Our research undertook co-design with people living with cognitive and sensory impairments and their proxies in order to explore new ways of facilitating communication. We developed simple functioning interactive prototypes to support people with a diverse range of competencies to communicate and explore their use. Deployment of the prototypes enabled use, appropriation and design after design by our two participant groups; adults living with cognitive or sensory impairments and children identified with language delays and autism spectrum disorder. The prototypes supported concrete expression of likes, dislikes, capabilities, emotional wants and needs and forms of expression that hitherto had not been fostered, further informing design. Carers and designers were surprised at the ways in which the technology was used and how it fostered new forms of social interaction and expression. We elaborate on how design after design can be an effective approach for engaging people living with intellectual disabilities, giving them greater capacity for expression and power in design and offering the potential to expand and deepen their social relationships.""Bringing designers together as successful design teams is investigated in the context of the science of complex systems. The relational structure inherent in design defines multilevel multidimensional networks, which can represent part-whole hierarchies in design. Design is presented as an iterative top-down and bottom-up process that induces the emergence of desirable properties. This involves the construction and instantiation of multilevel representations. The implications of this are discussed for computer supported collaborative design, and how interaction structures can be designed to support design collaboration. The paper is aimed at a general reader and is self-contained.""Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of multi-disciplinary collaboration in New Product Development (NPD). As such, interactions between industrial designers and engineering designers have become increasingly important. This research project aims to build a shared understanding between the two disciplines during NPD. Following empirical research that revealed collaboration-related problem areas, as well as collecting data concerning the use of design representations, a card system was developed to provide information on the role and significance of design representations, leading to joint understanding, improved communication and creation of shared knowledge. When asked in the validation study if the system would foster collaboration, 68.2% of industrial designers and 63.2% of the engineering designers gave a good and excellent rating, indicating that the system could play a significant role towards the support of multi-disciplinary teamwork.""The emergence of human-centred design strategies has directed attention to the role of empathy within design. While research on co-design acknowledges the potentially improved outcomes of using an empathic design approach, a comprehensive analysis on how empathy functions throughout the design process has been minimally explored in this literature. In this study, we analysed a series of design review videos depicting students’ design procedures within a service-learning course. These student designers were tasked to design a universally accessible zip-line and access ramp along with associated features. Our objective was to explore how empathy functioned throughout the development of the students’ final design solutions, which included a zip-line access point, ramp and cheering platform. To guide our depiction of these empathic design pathways, we relied on a set of pre-established empathic design techniques utilised by student designers. We provide a visual summary of student designers’ empathic design techniques, the interrelation of these techniques, along with implications for how design educators might effectively embed empathy throughout design curricula.""This paper outlines the issues in effective utilisation of digital resources in conceptual design. Access to appropriate information acts as a stimulus and can lead to better substantiated concepts. The issues of presenting such information in a digital form for effective use are addressed in a review of digital libraries and groupware, with improved integration of these two technologies advocated to better support the concept generation task. The development of the LauLima learning environment and digital library is consequently outlined. Despite its attempts to integrate the designers' working space and digital resources, continuing issues in library utilisation and the migration of information to design concepts are highlighted through a project study. In light of this, new approaches to interaction for increased information use are outlined.""How to generate business is at play in most innovation projects today. Not only Internet-based businesses, but also traditional manufacturing companies with conventional product sales are currently challenged to consider alternative business models: service design, project sales, direct sales, etc. In participatory innovation the core assumption is that a broad spectrum of people, including users, can contribute to innovation. But is it possible to open up the process of business model innovation to participation from a wider circle than those marketing managers who typically devise new business schemes? In this article we discuss two participatory approaches to business modelling that move beyond spreadsheets and Post-it®Notes: one of using tangible objects to redefine business elements, and another of people themselves role-playing how an organisation can create, deliver and capture value. These approaches were developed in companies and educational settings and have proven extraordinarily successful in initiating conversations about how to innovate business in cross-disciplinary and cross-functional groups of participants. Relying on design theory, we study the ‘moves’ that participants make towards a new network configuration; in particular as such conceptual ‘moves’ are likely to be associated with the concrete, physical movements of people and objects. We claim that these approaches prove very engaging because business model innovation needs a focus on redefining the concepts we use and the roles that actors play in relation to each other.""In order to meet the increasingly complex demands of design in multidisciplinary teams, designers have to interact and thereby to interweave their mental models (MM). Yet, neither is it clear which content of MM should be shared to perform design tasks effectively, nor is the process of the development of shared mental models (SMM) quite understood. The two studies presented in this article were conducted to gain insights into the cognitive processes of designers working together in a team, and to clarify the impact of SMM on team performance. Process-oriented research strategies were applied to groups of mechanical engineering students and to multidisciplinary project teams in the automobile industry. The results indicated that not the SMM of the whole group but the SMM of subgroups were related to group performance. Moreover, this link to performance is only supported by the SMM about team members' skills (SMMteam) and about the process of interaction (SMMprocess). As a conclusion of the latter result, more attention should be paid to the development of common knowledge about group interaction and team members' abilities in the everyday work life of project teams. In addition, observational data showed that motivational aspects like the feeling of competence should be considered when analysing the influence of SMM. Finally, a conceptualisation of the development and interplay of mental submodels is proposed.""In this paper we propose temporary assemblies where the sharing of stories and concerns are facilitated. Possible challenges and characteristics of such temporary assemblies will be discussed through the project Threads – A Mobile Sewing Circle, which is designed in order to support conversations in relation to everyday use of information and communication technology as well as to other means of communication. The participants do not necessarily belong to an already existing community and do not need to reach a consensus. The discussion in this paper will focus on how the design of Threads allows and encourages the participants to bring past lived experiences to the table, as well as how the act of participating in the sewing circle brings out new concerns. Despite the transient character of this assembly we will also look at how the things produced in the sewing circle might support longer lasting, future conversations.""While many participatory design (PD) projects succeed in establishing new organisational initiatives or creating technology that is attuned to the people affected, the issue of how such results are sustained after the project ends remains an important challenge. We explore the challenge of sustaining PD initiatives beyond the individual project and discuss implications for PD practice. First, based on current PD literature, we distinguish between four ideal typical forms of sustainability: maintaining, scaling, replicating and evolving. Second, we demonstrate from a case study how these various forms of sustainability may be pursued in PD practice and how they can become a resource in reflecting on PD activities. Finally, we discuss implications for PD practice, suggesting that a nuanced conception of sustainability and how it may relate to PD practice are useful resources for designers and researchers before, during and after design processes.""A number of techniques from drama and theatre have been appropriated for use in design to stage performances with and about users. In this paper, we address how drama and play-making can benefit design at moments other than staging. Building on the work of drama-in-education scholar Gavin Bolton, we articulate design-relevant learning qualities of using drama in design. We recognise that significant moments of learning about human conditions and technology take place in making and managing staged performances. We point to how significant but often implicit design decisions are taken in the making of a play and study their conditioning effect on the continuation of a design process. The focus of our inquiry is on the development of an oblique angle and its indirect directive qualities as a pre-set framing for using drama in design as well as an emergent framing that follows fromusing drama in design.""Pioneering psychology and co-design research has highlighted the potential that multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) may help architects’ exploratory creativity that is a recursive search to discover an optimal match of novel and appropriate solutions. However, it has been not reported hitherto in what ways MUVE helps or obstructs architects’ exploratory creativity in individual and collaborative modes of collaboration. To investigate this issue, we compared MUVE and sketching media in face-to-face and remote collaboration modes, involving 22 pairs of architecture major students. Based on interview and video-observation, we discovered that (1) in MUVE, anthropomorphic avatars, which other media do not have, enabled individual and collaborative explorations to discover unexpected affordances of new solutions, with evaluation on physical properties and layouts of solutions. In addition, (2) co-presence with collaborator’s avatars enabled inspiration on new ways of problem-solving and puzzle-making through shared design processes and events, with co-evaluation on social aspects of design solutions. (3) Co-presence in a shared environment also allowed mutual co-exploration that promotes emerging creative solutions, with co-modification on design errors. As barriers of MUVE, (4) avatar’s immersion caused inconvenient perception to explore large-scaled environments and track collaborators’ different experiences, but the barriers were not reported in remote collaboration.""This paper explores interaction in graduate-level industrial design education. We outline two instances of how design reviews are conducted through social contexts and provide a theorised analysis of these instances. In particular, this paper considers how participants in a design review – both an instructor and students – enact aspects of role-oriented authority and affiliation within the context of the review. Through perspectives associated with ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, this paper discusses how a misunderstanding and a request (and the response to that request) are managed through speech, gesture, and gaze direction. We explore how the interactive, co-presence of an instructor and students impacts upon the overall performance of the review and show how some of the pedagogic practices of design education are enacted through the contexts of discourse and embodiment. This paper provides opportunities for design instructors, students, professionals and researchers to reflect upon the collaborative micro-activities of design education and to consider the impact that these may have upon participants’ experiences and perceptions of design education.""Branding is widely recognised in many walks of life as an important element in how we perceive and interact with a product, service, organisation, or person, and increasingly, a place. In turn, organisations that have an economic or political interest in a place-brand are looking to develop and capitalise on their brand. This paper explores the general context of place-branding and gives the case study of the process that was followed to put in place the foundations of a brand for West London. Branding in the context of West London combines the opportunity and challenge of collaborating across a large geographic region and with a diverse range of stakeholders. This context presents a complex set of issues and requires collaboration between heterogeneous groups of stakeholders.""Codesign techniques encourage designers and end-users to work together in the creation of design solutions, but often make assumptions about the ways in which participants will be able to communicate. This can lead to the unwitting exclusion of people with communication impairments from the design of technologies that have the potential to transform their lives. This paper reports our research into codesign techniques for people whose communication skills are impaired. A variety of techniques were explored on two projects; some were adaptations of existing codesign techniques, others were created specially. In both cases, the emphasis was on creating tangible design languages. The results illustrate how people with communication impairments can be given a voice in design and demonstrate the benefits of doing so.""his paper presents a case study in which social interactions in groups of adolescents were mapped in order to define a product interaction that suited the adolescents. A school class of 18 students, 13 – 15 years old, participated in this project. In the first phase of the study, cultural probing was used to identify the social groups in the school class. In the second phase, the students worked in these groups on a sensitizing package, after which each group participated in a generative session. By means of the probes and sessions, insights were obtained into the interactions, relationships, roles and personalities within each social group. Based on the insights, we formulated a design vision for a museum visit for school groups. This vision was made tangible in a concept design for a museum visit for the Netherlands Architecture institute.In this case study, social interactions were used as motivator and mechanism for creating a museum experience. But a similar approach may be valuable for the design of products that mediate in social activities. In the conclusions we suggest the development of tools and methods to support designers in designing products and services that fit within people's social lives.""This article starts from the paradox that, although participation is a defining trait of participatory design (PD), there are few explicit discussions in the PD literature of what constitutes participation. Thus, from a point of departure in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this article develops an analytical understanding of participation. It is argued that participation is a matter of concern, something inherently unsettled, to be investigated and explicated in every design project. Specifically, it is argued that (1) participation is an act overtaken by numerous others, rather than carried out by individuals and (2) that participation partially exists in all elements of a project. These traits are explicated in a design project called ‘Teledialogue’, where the participants are unfolded as networks of reports, government institutions, boyfriends, social workers and so on. The argument is synthesised as three challenges for PD: (1) participants are network configurations, (2) participation is an aspect of all project activities and (3) there is no gold standard for participation.""In this paper, we will be discussing how visualisations can facilitate participatory processes by way of conveying issues of public concern as ‘things’. In the line of Latour’s plea to ‘make things public’, visualisations can be purposefully designed to trigger and encourage public debates concerning a wide range of issues. For this, we explore how a visualisation can be both transparent (i.e. visualising the complex entanglement of backstories of an issue) and readable. Specifically, we clarify the aspect of designing a readable visualisation of ‘things’. First, drawing from different fields of literature (i.e. Information Visualisation, Science and Technology Studies and Human-Computer-Interaction) we will articulate three main aspects of readability: engaging people to interact with a visualisation of complex issues, supporting sense making and encouraging reflection. Then, based on three empirical case studies, we indicate different design considerations in terms of engaging people to interact with a visualisation: contextualising a visualisation (via its location or medium), staging interaction and allowing people to provide their own perspective on the issue displayed. As a conclusion we propose a scenario that allows the visualisation to gradually become more transparent in support of its readability.""Past research has demonstrated that there are several factors that oppose group efficiency in idea generation. However, recent developments in theory suggest that individuals may become socially and cognitively facilitated as a result of idea exchange with group members. A design experiment was performed to study whether idea-exchanging individuals outperform those who work independently, in conditions found beneficial based on theoretical implications. We developed a scheme in which designers exchanged ideas with other's momentarily during the idea generation process, and compared their performance to designers that worked without any interaction. The study demonstrated that although idea-exchanging individuals generated more ideas, their performance was not enhanced in terms of the diversity of idea production. The results are interpreted in terms of a dual influence model of idea exchange.""The increasing interest in engaging users and other partners in collaborative design has led to an increase in the number of methods for organising collaboration. The aim of these methods is to support collaborative explorations of future opportunities in inspiring atmospheres. In this discourse, design games have become a popular concept that has been widely adopted to describe various design activities, which at first glance do not necessarily share many qualities. This paper aims to provide further understanding about the purposes that design games serve in codesign. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a play framework that highlights three perspectives on how design games appear to different people experiencing them: as a tool, as a mindset and as a structure. To clarify the components of design games, the paper reflects on the relations between design and games, the two parts of the concept ‘design games’, and two further qualities embedded in games: play and performance.""User experience is becoming a key term in the world of interactive product design. The term itself lacks proper theoretical definition and is used in many different, even contradictory, ways. This paper reviews various existing approaches to understanding user experience and describes three main approaches and their differences. A missing perspective is noted in all three: their focus is on only the individual having the experience and neglects the kinds of experiences that are created together with others. To address this, a new elaboration called co-experience is presented. It builds on an existing approach but borrows from symbolic interactionism to create a more inclusive interactionist framework for thinking about user experiences. Data from a study on mobile multimedia messaging are used to illustrate and discuss the framework.""After the eras of the Commodity Economy, the Manufacturing Economy, the Service Economy and the Information Economy, we have now entered the era of the Dream Economy. In the Dream Economy, success in the marketplace is not only about meeting people's practical needs, but also about meeting their aspirations and providing a positive emotional experience. The key to success is an in-depth and holistic understanding of people—their needs, their hopes, their fears, their aspirations, their dreams. This paper gives an overview of the Dream Economy and includes a series of case studies illustrating companies who have succeeded through a deep understanding of consumers and the delivery of an offer that meets their needs and desires at a deeper level. An anthropological framework for in-depth understanding of people is given and eight trends are identified, describing issues that are influencing their requirements both now and in the future.""We investigated whether people's perception of the pleasantness and forcefulness of aerosol sprays can be influenced by the particular sounds that aerosols make when used. Participants had to rate the pleasantness and forcefulness of aerosol samples sprayed either in front of them (Experiment 1) or else onto their own bodies (Experiment 2). The aerosol sprays were perceived as being significantly more pleasant (but significantly less forceful) when either the overall sound level elicited by the spraying action was reduced, or when just the high-frequency sounds were attenuated. These results provide a proof-of-principal demonstration that auditory cues can modulate the perceived pleasantness and forcefulness of aerosol sprays. The novel psychophysical approach to affective design outlined here enables a product designer or engineer to rapidly evaluate a range of potential new product sounds in order to ascertain the kind of sounds that consumers like to hear when using a product. We also outline some of the current challenges in this area, such as the need to develop more ecologically valid product sound manipulations for use in future research.""In collaborative design there is a need to create a shared understanding of design ideas and proposals. Misunderstandings and communication breakdowns often get in the way and need to be resolved. Little empirical research has addressed the use of design patterns in collaborative design work. An empirical study was carried out on students' collaboration while working on design tasks. Data were analysed using interaction analysis focusing on how the participants resolved misunderstandings and communication breakdowns, and the role of design patterns. Particular attention was paid to gaps in the collaboration; situations where designers had difficulties understanding each other and how to continue the design work. One type of gap concerned difficulties seeing or finding solutions to problems. However, many gaps concerned how to define or frame problems underlying design proposals. The results contradict the conception that design patterns are examples serving the role of inspiration for reuse of design ideas: simply showing a pattern solution was not enough to resolve gaps. The main observations were that patterns had an important role in overcoming difficulties in discussions regarding rationales and problem framing, and explicitly referring to design patterns by their names was decisive for the patterns to become useful.""Decision making in design requires careful consideration, as any inaccuracies or faults can have serious consequences for the producer, the user and/or the competitiveness of the company. Research investigating decision making in design so far has mainly focused on the selection of decisions as part of technical choices and classical optimisation problems. In recent years, further research has been started to discover the characteristics of successful decision making in industry. These later, mostly single case studies shed light on some general influences on decision making but so far have not identified different relevant patterns of decision-making processes in design teams which are influential on the result and the process of decision making, such as the constituents of rejected decisions. The research study reported here was initiated to further analyse the components of decision-making processes in teams, with special emphasis on the question of how decisions develop during the design process. For example, what happens to rejected decisions in the course of the design process? The observed processes should be analysed in detail by assessing all utterances in an interaction protocol which can be used as indicators of underlying cognitive processes in decision making; this research approach is usually called protocol analysis. In this experimental study using protocol analysis, rejected decisions were compared against those that were chosen to be used in designing the final outcome. The findings show how the designers develop the solution space and illustrate the analysis of decisions as a promising approach to analyse both the individual cognitive process and the contribution of the individual to the decision-making process in design teams.""This paper presents a field study exploring the challenges and implications of applying a participatory design process through the use of generative design tools with children using prosthetic legs in rural Cambodia in order to facilitate their involvement in the design process. First, it reviews the main research paradigms in which user research is conducted, including positivism, critical theory and interpretivism, and compares the paradigms in terms of the motives they carry for involving users in the design process. The case is then positioned in the interpretivistic research paradigm using philosophical hermeneutics as a guide. As the first application of generative design tools with children in developing countries who have special needs, the case revealed many challenges and pointed to the need to go well beyond the contextual domains typically addressed in user-centred or product-centred design today. The paper concludes by presenting the pyramid model, which designers can use to obtain an overview of the knowledge they need for developing a relevant solution, and to reflect upon how their understanding develops in this process.""The widespread use of participatory design (PD) has meant that different approaches and conceptualisations exist in this field today. In this article, it is argued that one fruitful approach is to rekindle a concern for values in design, focusing upon values as the engine that drives activities in PD. Drawing from the authors‘ own PD projects, this article shows how this can be accomplished: through designers enacting their appreciative judgement of values by engaging in a dynamic and dialogical process of cultivating the emergence of values, developing them and supporting their grounding.""In co-design there seems to be a widespread understanding that innovation is a planned, goal-oriented activity that can be propelled forward through well-facilitated events in which company employees collaborate with external parties (users in particular) and the conversations aim at consensus about new product and service ideas. Conflict belonged to the ‘old days’ when participatory design played a part in the struggle between workers and management. Based on the theory of complex responsive processes of relating, we suggest a new way of understanding innovation as the emergence of new meaning in – often conflictual – conversations. We argue that the meeting of participants with different stakes is crucial precisely because crossing intentions can create new insight and movement of thought and action. We use improvised theatre to investigate what happens in industrial (and other) organisations that embark on participatory activities, and the barriers that prevent them. By analysing improvised scenes and the way the audience reacts, we characterise the quality of conversations that seems to allow new meaning to emerge and thus stimulates innovation. We suggest that we need to develop new formats of collaboration for large, complex contingents of stakeholders, where conflicting intentions are encouraged.""The development of new ideas is an essential concern for many design projects. There are, however, few in-depth studies of how such ideas emerge within these contexts. In this article we offer an analysis of the emergence of ideas from specific sources of inspiration, as they arise through negotiation and transformation, and are mediated by design artefacts during an Inspiration Card Workshop, a collaborative event in which findings from domain studies are combined with technological sources of inspiration, in order to generate design concepts. We present a micro-analytic study of the interwoven social and artefact-mediated interactions in the workshop, and identify essential phenomena that structure and create momentum in the development of new design concepts, namely (1) the manifest properties of Inspiration Cards and Concept Posters as physical props for encouraging and supporting design moves, (2) the semantic dimensions of the cards and posters as catalysts for discussion, derivation and ideation, and (3) ad hocexternal sources of inspiration as means of supplementing and developing design concepts. The analysed design situation is characterised as being socially distributed, artefactually mediated, adaptive and emergent.""The aim of this research is to develop automated computational methods that visualise a particular social dimension of teamwork, the mutual expectations and shared knowledge that form the basis for effective collaborative work, to better facilitate its accurate analysis and interpretation. This teamwork dimension is operationalised as conceptual coherence, which is imputed from the semantic coherence of team communication. This paper presents three different information visualisation techniques for representing the social dynamics of design team collaboration based on the content of their communication. This collection of data representations was developed using a custom-made software toolkit that merges computational linguistic and information visualisation algorithms. Based on this research, several teamwork visualisation guidelines have been derived in order to transform the communications of design teams into useful devices for quantifying and representing social accounting metrics concerning the level and quality of their collaborative interactions over time.""Over the last few decades there has been a growing interest in the concept of emergence in design research. Despite this interest, the meaning and scope of emergence in design is not clear. Indeed, there are two different views of emergence in design literature, representing different types of theories about design. The first is focused on individual cognition or perception, and the second is focused on social aspects of design activity. This paper grapples with the question of how we can reconcile the two perspectives in a theory of design as an emergent phenomenon. More specifically, the paper builds a model of design as a distributed process that links together cognitive and social dimensions of design activity, and uses this model in order to elucidate the meaning and role of emergence in design. Overall, the paper explicates the relation between emergence, complexity and coordination as a vehicle for linking individual and social conceptions of design.""Much research on personas focuses on how to develop and use personas, less on the validation and concrete value of them in the development of products for cultures far away from the actual design site. This article illustrates how such a validation was accomplished through producing a film and it provides an in-depth case description of how personas were developed and used. When designing a waste management system for soft plastic for a small village in India, personas were developed and applied by the designer to maintain a user-oriented focus throughout the participatory design process. During a three-month stay in the village, personas based on real people and the villagers’ everyday life and practices were developed by getting to know people and their ways of life through the use of ethnographic methods (observations, interviews, workshops and a film). The personas created a substantial understanding of the users’ individual needs, interests, values and emotions and helped to overcome the physical and cultural distance, enabling a strongly contextualised design.""This paper gives a general and logical analysis of the expert position in design research by which methods for innovative design can be derived from expert design practices. It first gives a framework for characterising accounts of design by the way in which they define and relate general, descriptive and prescribed types of design practices. Second, it analyses with this framework the expert position’s conservatism of prescribing existing expert design practices to non-expert designers. Third, it argues that the expert status of expert designers does not provide sufficient justification for prescribing expert design practices to non-expert designers; it is shown that this justification needs support by empirical testing. Fourth, it discusses validation of design methods for presenting an approach to this testing. One consequence of the need to empirically test the expert position is that its prescription has to be formulated in more detail. Another consequence is that it undermines the expert position since expert design practices are not anymore certain sources for deriving design methods with. Yet it also opens the expert position to other sources for developing design methods for innovation, such as the practices of contemporary designers and the insights of design researchers.""Traditional aerospace design methods offer quick and efficient ways to generate new designs, but such that often resemble previous ones. For truly innovative design, however, a different approach is needed. This paper suggests that a general conceptual design method called ‘parameter analysis’ (PA) may be used for teaching and practicing innovative aerospace design. To support this proposition, we investigate four diverse, innovative and unique case studies, all carried out by very experienced aerospace designers: the ‘dam busting’ bouncing bomb of World War II, the Gossamer Condor human-powered plane of the 1970s, the asymmetric Boomerang twin-engine plane of the 1990s and the SpaceShipOne suborbital spacecraft of the early 2000s. The paper elaborates on how the methodology of case-study research has been adapted and applied to provide the evidence supporting the research hypothesis, and presents the results of analyzing the case studies. It shows that the expert aerospace designers followed a thought process similar to PA, even if unknowingly, where the similarity was measured by counting the number of PA characteristics that could be shown to exist in the case studies. Advantages and limitations of the research methodology are also discussed.""The architectural design is a process of solving multifaceted, ill-defined problems, requiring a constant dialog between internal representations (resulting of cognitive processes) and external representations based on the use of different media. This highly interactive process is very demanding on working memory and cognitive resources. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the way in which designers manage their cognitive load during the architectural design process and the creativity of their design outcomes. We quantitatively measured cognitive load by asking 36 architecture students to perform a secondary task while using three common design media (i.e., hand sketches, physical models, and SketchUp CAD software). The students' designs were then qualitatively assessed by eight expertraters, all of them were architects (four teachers and four professionals). Results did not reveal any significant relationship between cognitive load management and design outcome creativity for any of the three design media.""Since its inception, computational parametric design has been promoted as a means of supporting heightened creativity. In order to test three common claims about parametric design and creativity, this article describes the results of a study that compares the cognitive processes of a small set of designers, with the results of an independent assessment of the levels of creativity visible in their work. Specifically, using a combination of protocol analysis (of the design process) and consensual assessment (of the design outcome), the research explores three suggested indicators of a connection between cognitive activities and creativity. The three indicators are geometry versus algorithm use, problem-driven versus solution-driven processes, and expert versus novice activities. Through this research, the article contributes to a heightened understanding of the actual, rather than theorized, relationship between parametric design and creativity.""The aim of this paper is to show how the systemic approach makes it possible to redefine creativity; it highlights new ways to stimulate it in complex industrial contexts. A model was constructed from a state-of-the-art review categorized according to three conceptual scales (environment, individual, and object) using the systemic approach. It highlights three fundamental interactions (perceptual, cognitive, and social) that synthesize the mechanisms of creativity as a whole. From this model, three guidelines were proposed: the use of analogical tools to stimulate perceptual interactions, the use of a language based on visual forms to stimulate cognitive interactions, and the use of a cyclical process alternating individual, social and expert creativity to stimulate social interactions. Deployed together as an embedded method, we argue that these guidelines improve creative performance in complex contexts by focusing on interactions that stimulate the overall creativity system. We conclude with an implementation of this method in our industrial context (a car manufacturer), and test the guidelines in the context of real industrial projects.""A method for determining which product is more innovative than others and for determining the degree of innovation could be useful. Furthermore, such determination could focus on human–machine interaction. Based on a set of trends of evolution in interaction and on existing methods for the definition and quantification of innovation and related concepts, this research defines and quantifies innovation in interaction. This approach can help designers select the most innovative solution concepts and can help marketing experts establish their selling strategies; in addition, final users can be aided when choosing the best product to buy. This paper describes the definition of new metrics that focus on interaction in conjunction with a computational pipeline that uses these metrics to assess the presence and degree of innovation in interaction. An early validation of the results in the field is reported as well.""Generating novel ideas is a challenging part of engineering design, especially when the design task has been undertaken for an extended period of time. How can experienced designers develop new ideas for familiar problems? A tool called Design Heuristics provides strategies that support engineers in considering more, and more different, concepts during idea generation. Design Heuristics have been shown to help novice engineers create a set of more diverse and creative candidate concepts. In this case study, we extended this approach to a group of professional engineers who had worked on a specific product line for many years. In a workshop format, a small group of engineers worked with the heuristics in two separate sessions and generated ideas collaboratively. Video recordings were analyzed to reveal how the heuristics were used to stimulate new designs for their product line. We found thatDesign Heuristics bring order in ideas and elaboration on ideas, perhaps through coordinating effort on idea evaluation, increasing capacity to improve the ideas of others, and facilitating interaction between participants. This case study shows using Design Heuristics can assist even expert engineers to increase the variety of concepts generated, resulting in a larger set of ideas to consider.""Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE) is an element of lean practice in product development (PD), and it is composed of principles to apply it at early phase of a design process. However, executing the principles demands extensive efforts in practice. Thus, a systematic methodology is required to identify and prioritize potential areas (area in this paper is a generic term used to refer to subsystems, components or design factors or parameters a designer is applying SBCE process to explore, communicate and evaluate sets of solutions to satisfy a customer requirement or to solve a particular problem) where SBCE brings its utmost benefits. This paper proposes such a methodology called SBCE Innovation Roadmap (SBCE IR) that is used as a guideline by product designers to begin SBCE processes. A case study on Adiabatic Humidification System (AHS) is discussed to elaborate the application of the methodology in a real product system. Furthermore, by using the roadmap, a rack subsystem is selected to show how to use SBCE IR as an input for SBCE process, and further explore and evaluate innovative design concepts. Finally, an open questionnaire is prepared and interviews are made with experts to assess the advantages, applicability, and limitations of the methodology.""This paper aims at formalizing an innovation process well suited for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) specialized in retail. The design research consisted in analyzing conceptual models of innovation process from the literature and adapting it to the specific context. Indeed, the research issue deals with encouraging innovation activity in the context of small- and medium-sized retailers that have not yet integrated an intern design department. In the actual financial context, it is essential for SMEs to innovate in order to gain competitive advantage; but how to start a sized innovation activity? The undertaken research results in a plan that sets up a sized innovation activity gradually with a methodology conducting to repeated and regular new product development. Supported with international literature research, the paper contributes to the proposal of an innovation process meeting the two following requirements:  retailer lacking knowledge in innovation activity and an SME with limited financial means. From the industrial case studies that have been undertaken, an adapted process has been developed to ensure the success of innovation activity integration in this specific context.""This article describes a creative design activity to introduce engineering students to mechatronic prototyping. Our goal was to find a creative task to increase student confidence and skills in mechanical design, electrical circuits, microcontrollers, and programming. We present the Paper Robot exercise, a design activity that blends everyday materials such as cardboard, with electronic components. This activity was introduced during the 2010–2011 academic year and has been repeated every year since, in a global, industry-sponsored design course at Stanford University. The Paper Robot exercise resulted from the observation that students were intimidated to create functional prototypes with microcontrollers. The teaching team needed a way to quickly introduce tools for programming electronic components and to encourage creative experimentation early in the course. Results include a 100% task performance rate of students that successfully made a robot meeting the minimum requirements. 76% of students reported an increase in knowledge in programming microcontrollers (Arduino), and 69% increased their knowledge in creating electronic circuits out of raw components. This activity may be modified to introduce younger students to mechatronic platforms in STEM education curriculum.""Many products such as electronic appliances are made of imitation metals, which are lighter in weight and lower in cost than real metals. However, imitation metals sometimes look and feel cheap. This study proposes that differences in sound symbolic words associated with imitation and real metals can be used in metal texture design to make imitation materials look and feel like real materials. Japanese is known to have a large number of sound symbolic words, or “onomatopoeia,” for expressing textures. For example, onomatopoeia expressing a sense of smoothness often uses the consonant /s/ in the first syllable as in “sara-sara.” We conducted psychological experiments where participants were asked to observe a pair of imitation and real materials without touching them and respond with onomatopoeic words that they felt were associated with them. Participants used significantly more onomatopoeic words for real materials than for imitation materials. Furthermore, we analyzed onomatopoeia obtained for both real metals and imitation metals using a system that quantifies the phonological information of onomatopoeia. The comparison of the onomatopoeia evoked by real metals and those evoked by imitation metals revealed differences in their texture feelings.""This paper presents a multi-dimensional perspective for the study of creativity and formulates a framework for computational creativity that enables the definition of functional relationships among scales, and captures the effects of time. Its relevance and usefulness are shown first by classifying recent studies of computational creativity and second by illustrating multi-dimensional approaches to the computational study of creativity with sample simulation scenarios. The paper closes offering modeling guidelines for the computational studies of creativity.""Studying design creativity and innovation from practical perspectives for companies requires both a good understanding of the company ecosystem and its inner processes contributing to delivered innovations and a rigorous design research methodology to provide effective design models, methods, and platforms that are truly effective in the context of a company. Working in an industrial engineering laboratory, we advocate a more systemic vision of design creativity and innovation in company ecosystems. We present in this paper an attempt to develop and make professional an innovation engineering. Our research works are illustrated along the different research topics of an innovation process. We start by a recent survey on innovation practice and organizational models led in 28 large companies. The lessons learned about this survey reinforce our belief that there is a need for a new method in agile management of radical innovation projects in company contexts. We currently develop, test, and apply such a methodology named Radical Innovation Design ® (RID). Its effectiveness has been evaluated through a large-scale evaluation of the project outcomes for the company. Two extensions of RID have been proposed and deployed in company contexts: a selection procedure for innovation clusters and a value-driven process for airplane development projects.""The Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) is considered one of the gold standards for creativity assessment, and graphic design, arguably, is the most ubiquitous domain within the creative industries. For the first time, this study tests two tasks to measure graphic design creativity, and by extension, the reliability of the CAT as a measure of graphic design creativity. Initial research suggested the level of consensus amongst judges (often referred to as inter-rater reliability) was too low to be reliable, and may be unduly influenced by a judge’s preference for technical execution. In this study, 16 professional graphic designers were randomly assigned instructions to discount technical execution from creativity ratings, or given instruction that gave no stipulation, for 60 artworks. Inter-rater reliability scores were acceptable for each task and experimental condition, but were higher for judges that received instructions to discount technical execution. These and other results are discussed, and the argument presented that, for future CAT studies in this domain, specific instructions to discount technical execution offers a more reliable measure of graphic design creativity.""Design fixation is a major concern in engineering idea generation because it restricts the solution space in which designers search for their ideas. For designers to be more creative, it is essential to mitigate their fixation. The majority of studies in the literature investigate the role of pictorial stimuli in design fixation; however, the role of examples presented in other formats, including physical prototypes, is largely unknown. This paper presents a study that compares design fixation, in novice designers, caused by pictorial and physical representations. The effects of defixating materials proposed by Linsey et al. (2010) are also investigated. The results show that physical formats cause a higher magnitude of fixation than pictorial formats; however, participants utilizing physical examples produce a greater quantity of nonredundant ideas. Consistent with prior studies, the results also indicate that the defixation materials may not facilitate mitigation of novice designers' fixation.""Research shows that East Asians generally value creativity when it brings about evolutionary changes and promotes moral and social values. With an aim to further understand the concept and cultural foundation of creativity in East Asia, this article focuses on Confucius' concept of junzi (exemplary or paradigmatic person). It is argued that a junzi embodies creativity in three main ways. First, a junzi exercises creativity by actively interpreting experiences and constructing personal meanings within one's sociocultural context. Second, a junzi's creativity is grounded in and motivated by one's moral duty to achieve humanity and social harmony. Third, a junzimanifests creativity by bringing about an intermediate rather than radical domain change in society. The article concludes with the key implications of an East Asian concept of creativity for design creativity and innovation.""The underlying hypothesis of this paper is that the rigor needed to build computational design creativity systems will produce insights that will increase our understanding of creativity. The paper points to a variety of factors that will need to be studied and understood in detail in order to build such systems. It examines selected technical literature about creativity to determine what key characteristics have been proposed as underlying creative production. In addition, as the existence of creativity is a judgment relative to personal or group norms, it is helpful to understand what factors inform that judgment. Besemer's creative product semantic scale for product assessment provides three dimensions, with nine attributes that can be used for judgments. This paper discusses how creative product assessment scales might provide important clues about how to build computational systems in order to produce creative products.""A great deal of work has been done to characterize entire sets of ideation indicators as well as isolated factors of innovativeness. Nevertheless, entire sets ofinnovativeness indicators are essential in business innovation competitions, as well as within companies in order to select promising innovation seeds. In this paper, a complete set of innovativeness indicators in the context of innovating in healthcare is proposed. The UNPC innovativeness model, standing for usefulness, newness,profitability and (proof of) concept, has been tested and validated over a period of 4 years within the largest European innovation cluster in the silver economy. Four authentic examples of innovation selections are analyzed. They illustrate how the UNPC model is able to provide clear and efficient guidance for better decision-making in the context of innovating for the elderly. In addition, a framework for monitoring an innovative idea or project, and for increasing its maturity, is proposed. The UNPC monitoring process starts with the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis of competing ideas. It then becomes dynamic, looking for new evidence for increasing the certainty and impact of UNPC proofs of the competing ideas. The model has been successfully used for upgrading a popular smart application on activity tracking.""This paper describes the perceptions and views of creativity among a selection of the UK-based design tutors. The study presents the findings of research that has questioned a total of 16 design tutors in architecture and industrial design in a leading UK university that specializes in design education. The researchers adopted a semi-structured interview approach and collected a series of rich insights into how design tutors conceptualize creativity and how they perceive their role in developing creativity in their students. The findings show that design tutors clearly value creativity, but, at the same time, they find it very difficult to define and conceptualize. The results also show that the tutors were unable to articulate how they helped their students develop their own creativity. Moreover, the results reveal that the design tutors would value understanding creativity more in order to improve their teaching.""This paper focuses on Quirky, a social product development (SPD) company, in order to explore the SPD phenomenon, as well as the self-assessed level of the experience quality arising from participation in SPD. The study investigates the perceived benefits to designers arising from their participation, the motivators of participation, as well as the participants’ perception of SPD characteristics. It involved a focus session with seven industrial design engineering master students, and yielded results from which a questionnaire was developed within the study. The questionnaire was completed by voluntary participants (7 trained designers and 26 non-design trained participants) from the worldwide community of platform users of the selected SPD company. The questionnaire results suggest that the positive aspects of the SPD participants’ experience include the interest caused by participation and motivation to earn money, as well as the perception of a wide range of ideas and contributions available in the SPD platform. Negative aspects of the participants’ experience found in the analysis of the questionnaire data include high individual ratings for learning caused by participation as well as a keen awareness of too many unnecessary ideas in the SPD platform. The analysis also suggests that formally trained designers have some advantage in SPD participation compared to non-design trained participants. Finally, the results support the conclusion that the questionnaire respondents did not view SPD as detrimental to designers’ future job prospects.""The effect of antecedent group interaction on individual ideation is investigated, through an experiment based on generation of concepts by two groups of industrial design students following the same design brief. The underlying hypothesis is that preceding individual ideation with group interaction promotes increase in effectiveness of individual ideation. Results were analyzed for maximum novelty of individual ideation, showing a positive post-treatment effect, departing sharply from the novelty degradation in the control group in the second phase of the experiment. Analysis of the ideation outcomes using a variety metric, complement the findings obtained for novelty, in characterizing the effect of group interaction in creative ideation, demonstrating an inverse effect of previous group interaction leading to decreased variety of ideation.""An emerging thread of research is represented by the attempt of quantitatively assessing creativity, its dimensions, and how it influences the design process. The purpose of the task is to compare design options, thus allowing to select the most innovative and supposedly profitable alternative. The endeavor of previous works has consisted in the assessment of creativity concerning designers, methodologies, concepts, and products. As the scope of engineering design is expanding so to include not traditional aspects of the product development process, the paper proposes metrics tailored to evaluate the creativity of services. Such metrics are built as a result of the extension and adaptation of previously formulated criteria, including the evaluation of novelty and usefulness. A sample of successful innovative services is considered, giving rise to a considerable variability of creativity scores. The outcomes may represent a starting point for a wider discussion about which dimensions of creativity majorly impact the success of products and services in the marketplace.""Design is a cyclical journey from creative ideas to concrete realizations of those ideas though prototyping. Designers today have increasing access to low-cost technology toolkits within the electronic and computational domain. However, for technical novices, including electronic components in prototypes can hamper the ability to create novel ideas by introducing technical obstacles. Electronic modules can increase the probability of prototyping success, at the cost of reduced design flexibility. This research (1) presents the results of a pilot usability evaluation of (N = 68) participants making physical light emitting diode (LED) light creations with non-modular electronics components, and (2) uses this evaluation to motivate a creative prototyping study (N = 86) exploring the question: ‘How does prototyping tool modularity influence the creative result?’ Using a browser-based crowd platform (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk), participants created electric ‘creature circuits’ with LEDs in a virtual prototyping environment. We found that increasing the modularity of LED components (i) increased the novelty rating of prototypes as rated by a condition-blind panel, (ii) increased the quantity of prototypes created and the quantity of LEDs used by study participants, (iii) increased participants’ degree of perceived self-efficacy and cognitive flow, and (iv) reduced the number of errors due to LED polarity. The results highlight that novice prototyping with electronics is difficult due to the number of possible ways to fail. The findings show that modularity can reduce the chance of errors and improve the likelihood of creating novel prototypes.""Engineering students need to learn to collaborate, to create and to innovate in culturally diverse socio-organisational contexts. However, research on intercultural differences provides results that are not specifically grounded in collaborative and creative engineering education practices. This paper presents a contrastive case study of engineering students’ appraisals of the quality of collaboration in collaborative design situations. Based on an extended multidimensional appraisal method (called ‘QC2’), we contrasted French and Japanese engineering students’ appraisals of: (1) ideal collaboration in design; (2) quality of collaboration with respect to actual cases of collaborative design in France and in Japan (as shown on videos). Results showed a common French–Japanese culture of collaboration across the engineering students with respect to aspects of design relating specifically to the domain of engineering, yet differences with respect to appraisals of dimensions of group work (task/group orientation and argumentation). These results, of a detailed situated case study, are compared with results of (mostly questionnaire-based) research on general cultural differences. We conclude with prospects for elaborating an operational trans-cultural concept of institutional culture of collaboration, and implications for training engineering students, especially for multicultural collaboration.""This article offers new perspectives on how diversity can serve as a driver for transformation in creative teamwork at the point of conflict. The majority of professional design work takes place in teams, and the teaching and facilitation of different aspects of creative teamwork is thus of value in design education. Research shows that diversity supports creativity in groups; however, diversity is also the road to possible conflict (Basadur, M. (2004). Leading others to think innovatively together: Creative leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 103–121; Darsø, L. (2001). Innovation in the making. Copenhagen: Samfundslitteratur; Leonard, D., & Straus S. (1997). Putting your company's whole brain to work. Harvard Business Review, 111–121). This article builds on theory and practical applications from the fields of creativity and psychology, as well as a case study where a team of Danish design and Ghanaian art students requests supervision to overcome a conflict. Findings in the present study indicate that helping the team to actively see and appreciate diversity at the point of conflict can lead to transformation at three levels: individual reflection and practice, the relationships and ways of working in the team, and in the project itself, where new choices and opportunities become available.""Designers and engineers in practice can rely on a comprehensive assortment of physical connections such as bolts, adhesives, and snap joints to design a product. However, future materials, processes, and technologies lead to other requirements. Designers must be creative to find new solutions that meet the new requirements. The Design to Connect method presented in this paper was developed to support designers in the ideation of new connections in products. It provides inspiration to expand their design space and support them to generate more ideas. The tool contains 46 cards. Each card contains a heuristic and is illustrated with an inspirational example. Six design drivers can be used to select a subset of the most relevant inspiration cards for a specific context. The tool and the framework are both evaluated in an experimental setup with a relevant sample of novice designers with different educational backgrounds. The results demonstrate that the participants generate significantly higher number of ideas and explore a larger solution space when they apply the tool cards. Selecting a set of relevant inspiration cards in advance does not have a significant effect on the amount of ideas or the size of the solutions space. Furthermore, most participants prefer a less structured approach in their ideation and those with a more abstract level of education explored more ideas and a larger solution space compared to participants with a more practical education.""This article proposes a new descriptive framework, which we label as the “ideation framework” (IF), of the design process from a dual cognitive-engineering perspective, partly based on existing frameworks from both fields and previous work by the author. The framework is for the ideation or front-end phase of the product development process, representing the interface between cognitive psychology and engineering design. Three domains – inspiration, decomposition, and integration – and three spaces – problem-space, idea-space, and concept-space – are the elements of the framework. The iterative flow of the engineering design process passes through the three domains in a semi-controlled way, through a sequence of specialization and generalization process loops in and between the spaces. An empirical descriptive examination of the ideation process is performed using designers with limited design experience. The designers were faced with a design problem that they had to solve in a limited period of time. Their designs were analyzed, and a post-exercise interview was done to uncover each of the participants' design process. The empirical work indicates these designers worked in a manner largely consistent with the IF.""The concept of design-led innovation is gaining importance in both the design studies and innovation research areas by drawing attention to design and its strategic value for innovation. This paper offers a critical review of academic articles, books, and national innovation assessment instruments on the conceptualizations and claimed outcomes of design-led innovation. The review identified three conceptualizations: outcome-, process-, and dominant logic-oriented conceptualizations, which differ in the manner by which design influences innovation outcomes. Claimed innovation outcomes include new to market products and services, competitive advantage, strategic change, and intellectual property. Empirical studies show a direct link between the qualities of the designed artifact on market-oriented innovation metrics. National innovation instruments likewise point to design as positively influencing multi-factor productivity. However, the review did not uncover any article presenting data to refute a null hypothesis relating to the positive influence of design on innovation, and empirical studies linking the intensity of design-led processes or degree of design-led capabilities to innovation performance remain inconclusive. This lack of evidence suggests that the concept of design-led innovation may be, at least at the moment, more a perspective rather than a set of evidence-based practices.""Human civilization can be ameliorated by human creativity. Innovation and progress of human civilization result from a change in our thinking patterns, thus, potentially transforming the present into a creative future. Accentuating the role of creativity in design even more than other disciplines pushes one to underpin the understanding of creativity as a key role player in architecture. Furthermore, by identifying the basic principles of our ingenuity/creativity, researchers might be able to enhance this ability in the future. The digital era allows for a new domain of architectural experience. It is assumed that new designs in virtual environments can be created that go beyond the mere accommodation of literal functions, and affect human experiences. This paper presents the role of a method developed by the authors: ‘Proto-Fuse’, experimented with, as an artwork for the survey of cognitive perception of humans, specifically targeting enhancement of spatial creativity. The logic behind this method is based on two psychological concepts: 1 – conceptual blending, 2 – tolerance of ambiguity. Two experimental projects were conducted for exploring the Proto Fuse method: (a) “unconventional virtual environments (UVEs)” to improve conceptual blending and (b) “Extracting local distance” to enhance tolerance of ambiguity.""This paper presents an experimental study of measuring and comparing design cognition while using different concept generation creativity techniques in a collaborative engineering design setting. Eleven design teams were given the same three design tasks, respectively, using an unstructured concept generation technique (brainstorming), a partially structured technique (morphological analysis), and a structured technique (TRIZ). A protocol analysis was carried out using the function–behavior–structure ontologically based coding scheme. This study showed that the students' design cognition was affected by the degree of structuredness of the concept generation creativity techniques they applied in their designing. The more structured a concept generation creativity technique is, the more likely that designers using this technique tend to focus more on problem-related aspects of designing, i.e., design goals and requirements. Results also indicate that the influence of the structuredness of concept generation creativity techniques mainly affects the early parts of the designing process, and differences between different design conditions exhibit an overall commonality of designing.""Collaboration has often been attributed to encouraging creativity. This assumption is explored here by investigating the influence of interactions between designers on creativity-relevant cognitive processes. It is proposed that design interactions stimulate creativity-relevant cognitive processes through collaborative stimulation. This paper specifically explores how the cognitive process of memory retrieval is stimulated through collaboration by prompting. It is hypothesized that collaboration leads to more stimulation of memory retrieval by design entities than working alone. A study using protocol analysis was conducted to evaluate this claim. It was found that the collaborative stimulation of prompting exists and that the collaborative setting leads to design entities stimulating more cases of memory retrieval. The result is explained through fixation, and recommendations are made for how these findings can be used to improve collaborative methodologies.""Idea generation is an important part of the engineering design process, and therefore significant research efforts have focused on developing methods to support designers in generating ideas. A key factor is the measurement of ideation effectiveness. The effectiveness of idea generation methods can be measured using metrics such as novelty, variety, quantity, and quality. Average novelty (AN) of a set of ideas is also used as one of the ideation metrics. However, the interdependency between AN and variety has been given little attention. An investigation of the interdependency between these metrics is important to enhance our understanding of the metrics of ideation, and thereby to develop methods for improving ideation effectiveness. This article examines the interdependency between AN and variety. In addition, the metric ‘individual average novelty (IAN)’ has been introduced, and the interdependency between ‘IAN’ and variety has been investigated.""Creativity is widely seen as an important subject in the study of the engineering design process. Through analysis using a previously presented framework and coding scheme, this study presents two studies on creative designer behavior within later design stages. Through the studies, one being longitudinal and the other a laboratory experiment, two creative approaches have been identified based on whether designers are more often creative when developing the knowledge and variables available for the design or the design output itself. This individual difference correlates significantly with the designers' creative style as measured by an independent creative style test. These data demonstrate the variation in designer behavior that appears even when completing identical tasks. By understanding the creative behavior and approaches followed by designers, it will be possible to develop specific and particularly appropriate methods of designer support, dependent on the stage of the design process and particular approach of the designer.""The selection of sources of inspiration is a crucial moment while designing, as it can enhance design creativity. Designers seem to prefer using pictorial representation modalities despite empirical investigations indicating possible disadvantages of such unimodal approaches. Therefore, it is valid to ask whether designers are disregarding other available stimuli, such as textual representations. In order to answer this question and to find out about the usefulness of different textual stimuli during ideation phases, we exposed novice designers to three types of written stimuli, with different semantic levels. The results indicate that between close and very distant related types of stimuli, there is an intermediate type that is likely to stimulate participants to generate a larger number of more flexible and original ideas. This intermediate type of stimulus seems to prompt designers to generate ideas that are more creative in terms of fluency, flexibility, and originality. Conversely, the too close and the too distant stimuli reveal being less useful for creative problem solving. Looking into alternative types of stimuli, as well as stimuli entailing varying levels of distance with the problem at hand, can possibly help designers in increasing their creative potential.""Among Roland Barthes' theoretical universe, a central concept tends to be ignored – what Barthes defined as semioclastics {This term echoes with the famous historical iconoclasm}, i.e. the deconstruction of a symbol or a semiotic system. In this article, we claim that semioclastics can be applied as an inherent part of the design toolkit and for understanding design processes. Although the presence of function makes the possibility of a total deconstruction of the original symbol difficult, we would like to reveal the spectrum of interpretations of the term and the way it expands the limits of design. Taking under consideration that design will always refer to questions of usability, we wish to portray the changes in attitude towards the product and its sign, while looking through a “semioclastics filter.”""The case study demonstrates the application of conceptual blending to generating a new concept of table lamp with a metaphor of Taiwan aboriginal culture. The design process uses the framework and principles of conceptual blending to identify design target as the first input space, explore possible design sources as the second input space, and consequently integrate these input spaces into a new blended space as a solution. It starts with a working frame for the input spaces to seek an appropriate structure for the blending and ends at the blended space with metonymy of Thao tribe's sun-shooting myth. The table lamp prototype that conceptualizes the blended space was displayed at an exhibition, namely, YODEX 2011, to evaluate its perceived quality of pleasure and metaphor by visitor interviews; results show rather positive. Major implications include the emphasis on bodily-level frame for promoting emergent structure for blending, the importance of using metonymy tightening principle, and the development of guidelines of applying concept blending to product design by designing more exemplars.""A new cognitive theory of innovation, the Obscure Features Hypothesis (OFH), is applied to the area of engineering design innovation. The OFH states that all innovative solutions are built upon at least one overlooked (i.e., obscure) feature of the problem at hand. In this paper, we first highlight the types of features that exist and the cognitive obstacles that hinder people's ability to notice the obscure members of various feature types. We then detail five innovation techniques we have developed to help designers search the obscure realms of the space of features. Each of these techniques counteracts a specific cognitive obstacle to innovation: design fixation, functional fixedness, narrow verb associations, assumption blindness, and analogy blindness. We compare our approach with other approaches to innovation in psychology (the representation change view and the distant association view) and engineering (theory of inventive problem solving and C–K theory). Finally, we show how the innovation techniques can be implemented in software to assist users in the design process.""Concept generation plays a vital role in establishing a broader foundation in the design process to create novel products. In the globalized, collaborative, designing scenario, an unambiguous representation of captured ideas to explicate a designer's thoughts is important in the sharing and reuse of concepts. Various design studies have noted the impact of design tools on concept generation. However, the results did not detail the influences of a variety of tools on the representation and reinterpretation of concepts through captured design documents. The goal of this paper was to understand the influence of conceptual design tools: Hi-Tech®Mobile e-Notes TakerTM, Wacom® Tablet, and Rhinoceros®CAD with MS Word/PowerPoint on concept representation and reinterpretation, during the original and redesign phases. Eighteen design experiments, involving six individual student designers' solving three design problems each, were conducted in the original and redesign phases. The analyses of 26 variables from captured documents and video protocols reveal that the design tools had a statistically significant impact on four key variables: the total time taken to solve each problem, the time spent on detailed design activity, the textual representation of structural requirements, and the graphical representation of the structure of detailed concepts. Irrespective of the design tool used, novice designers generated a low number of redesign concepts. This makes us conclude that designers might require training for reinterpretation and extracting necessary information from the concepts originally captured, rather than working with poor understanding, ambiguity, and assumptions about the original designer's intent.""Even though there has been a considerable interest in creativity and design as collaborative efforts more recently, there is yet a need for models that provide an integrative perspective on collaborative creative design. While cognitivist accounts of creativity are still quite dominant in the field of design research, it is argued in this article that respective models fall short of accounting for the emergent properties and structures that arise out of the interaction of human actors with their environment. To be able to account for the social and material contingencies out of which different forms of creative design take shape, a practice-oriented perspective is explicated and its implications are discussed. The intent of this article is to open up a new research agenda that helps to understand how creative practices take shape and are enacted in specific settings.""Ideas and concepts are the carriers of innovation, which many regard as a critical source of competitive advantage. At the same time, an initial idea is untested and unrealized, i.e., it is always surrounded by a lack of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different types of ideas develop and interact with knowledge, by focusing on remediating activities performed by design teams. Results are based on a retrospective interview study involving respondents from eight projects, all selected for their high degree of innovativeness. The analysis emphasized two types of ideas (product ideas and concept ideas) and three spaces of design knowledge (the why-space, the what-space, and the how-space). The results reveal two possibilities: either the content of the knowledge space differs depending on the type of idea, or different knowledge spaces exist. Moreover, activities conducted to improve the idea have different characteristics depending on the type of idea. It is thus important to distinguish between different types of ideas and to choose corresponding mitigation activities to support idea development.""This study examines how a manner of use of a product can influence a travelers' subjective experience during the peak passenger traffic season in mainland China. A survey has been utilized to conduct empirical studies on passenger's emotional satisfaction. Qualitative methods are adopted to analyze subjective experience, and emotional satisfaction of passengers on the trains. The analysis is based on responses collected via an online sample survey questionnaire and field questionnaire at Wuchang railway station to investigate the emotional descriptions of train travel experience. The results indicated that passenger's experienced better emotional satisfaction after they utilized a travel-assistive product on the train carriage. As well, negative emotions are found in semantic descriptions of passengers through questionnaires, field observations, and direct interviews. These findings suggest that passengers' subjective experience is a linear functional relation, and the manner of use of a creative product may provide possible solutions to improve a passengers' subjective experience. The results provided a view on the negative emotions of subjective experience that were the foremost influencing factor on emotional satisfaction. These represent the source for creativity and innovation with respect to train design. The study also showed there is a huge market for the design of travel-assistive products that serve travelers, and a challenge and opportunity for designers to improve its possible social effects.""Design fixation describes a phenomenon in which designers fail to solve a design problem due to their strong mental attachment to an internal or external inspiring source. A number of empirical research studies aimed at identifying the causes behind design fixation and developing approaches for overcoming it. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model of design fixation in which the concepts of perceived fitness and expected fitness are introduced. Interpretation of existing findings on fixation and hypotheses are derived to show the applications of the model. In addition, a method of evaluation of design fixation is introduced and demonstrated with an example.""This research focuses on the development and use of applied experimental methods to analyze participant responses to color contrast, and color combinations, in order to describe the signs of simple and complex designs. This article presents the methodology and analysis results of the primary data collected from the research. The results of Study I and Study II in addition to Study III are reported in this article, with each study building iteratively upon the results of the previous study. This iterative method ensured a systematic approach that built on increasing knowledge of the influence of achromatic contrast, color contrast, and color combination, and the importance of each in contributing to design complexity. These results then contribute to the creation of a design tool that can aid designers and students in making informed color choices that are best suited to the design solution required. Color has the power to support or inhibit the design intention. In addition, color can either add complexity or simplify the appearance of the design form through different color contrasts and color combinations.""Scholars argue about the role played by surprise in making new products creative. Different perspectives evaluate surprise as a nuance of novelty, an independent dimension, or an emotional reaction to new products. The paper proposes a framework of factors supposedly characterizing the emergence of surprise in terms of individuals’ interpretations and/or modifications of products’ behavior and structure. Moreover, it illustrates the outcomes of a preliminary empirical investigation about the manifestation of unexpectedness according to such a framework: the proposed factors have been checked by interpreting the motivations leading to the presence of surprise in 12 new lamps described in the literature. The experiment states the reasonability of the described factors and, as a consequence, the paper provides a contribution to better articulate the debate in the research arena.""According to some casual observers, computer-aided design (CAD) tools are very similar. These tools are used to design new artifacts in a digital environment; hence, they share typical software components, such as a computing engine and human–machine interface. However, CAD software is dedicated to specific professionals – such as engineers, three-dimensional (3D) artists, and industrial designers (IDs) – who claim that, despite their apparent similarities, CAD tools are so different that they are not substitutable. Moreover, CAD tools do not fully meet the needs of IDs. This paper aims at better characterizing CAD tools by taking into account their underlying design logic, which involves relying on recent advances in design theory. We show that engineering CAD tools are actually modeling tools that design a generic variety of products; 3D artist CAD tools not only design but immediately producesingle digital artifacts; and ID CAD tools are neither a mix nor an hybridization of engineering CAD and 3D artist CAD tools but have their own logic, namely to create new conceptual models for a large variety of products, that is, the creation of a unique original style that leads to a generic singularity. Such tools are useful for many creative designers beyond IDs.""The increasing availability of large quantities of product-related data provides an opportunity to augment human designers with analytical models for evaluating the creativity of a new design. In this paper we describe three characteristics of a creative design: novelty, value, and surprise. We present an analytical framework for computationally evaluating the creativity of a new design. Building on our previous work, we associate each characteristic with a computational process, and develop a new model for evaluating surprise using predictive analytics. We describe an implementation of our analytical models as applied to a data-set of mobile devices. We report on the most surprising devices identified by our models and their corresponding novelty and value scores, and conclude by discussing the broader applications and implications of an analytical approach to evaluating creative designs.""This paper explores the design collaboration between designers and expert users in the specific case of new surgical instrument design. To this end, two design evaluation meetings were studied. Decision and interaction analysis methods were applied to compare the effectiveness of the design team on discussing and solving design issues with and without active participation of the expert user. The observations showed that, in the absence of the user, the designers were unable to make decisions about technical solutions relating to usability issues, and the expert user's comments during the subsequent meeting significantly altered their decisions. These two observations indicate that the use of a support tool could have a significant role to help asynchronous communication in such a design process.""Architectural designers, engineering designers, and instructional designers engage in the design process when developing new products. In the area of design, an accomplished designer must possess a high degree of expertise in order to design and produce quality products. Previous research has demonstrated that much of the empirical research in design not only ignores expertise but has actually been carried out by studying novice designers. An expert designer is someone recognised to be a reliable source of knowledge who has demonstrated proven abilities, skills, and judgment in a given discipline or field. Understanding these characteristics is the key to opening the door to new knowledge in the design process. This study examines criteria that elevate a designer to a level of expertise and offers a model to assist in the identification of a design expert.""Three case studies of expert practice in engineering and product design are reported. The studies are of exceptional designers and comprise one protocol study and two retrospective interview studies. In each case, an example of the designer’s approach to a particular design problem is presented. Comparisons between the three examples are drawn, and there appear to be some striking similarities in the designers' strategies, despite the very different project examples. A general descriptive model of creative strategies in design is developed from these commonalities.""The present study examined the design process as a socially and physically mediated activity. This activity was investigated in the context of design education, where students imported their design proposals into the virtual design studio; then, with external domain experts, they discussed and modified them. The study proposed a framework for constructing the horizontal and vertical development of design representations and for analysing expert participation through these representations within the virtual design studio. The results indicated that the design representations had an essential role in the process of continually improving design ideas. The conceptual and visual representations served as a basis for experts to evaluate and question students' design proposals or to create new ideas. In addition to the virtual collaboration, the feedback and ideas from the prototype-testing situation played a very substantial role in students' design decisions.""This paper proposes a model of expertise of temporary design teams. We start by outlining a situated view of expertise as being grounded in individual experience, which emphasises its applicability and teleology. We use the construct of a computational agent to model the individual expert. We then show the advantages of the function-behaviour-structure (FBS) schema to represent the knowledge of a situated agent, which includes its knowledge about other agents. The ability of an agent to construct knowledge about the behaviour and parts of the knowledge of other agents has been found to be needed to allow social interaction among agents. Based on individual agents and their FBS views of one another, we then develop a model of expertise of temporary design teams that emerges from the interaction of individual experts. This bottom-up model is sensitive to changes in the composition of the team: some experts might leave the team while others join. However, the team members can usually establish the expertise of the new team without much effort as they can build upon their generalised knowledge gained from previously working in similar teams. We claim that our model provides a better understanding of team expertise and a basis for computational simulations of design teams.""This study investigated the use of visual analogy in architectural design. Its purpose was to provide some understanding of the way experts and novices apply visual analogical thinking to generate satisfactory solutions during the design process. Although there are several anecdotal examples in the design literature that have reported the use of analogy, few studies have empirically explored the relationship between analogy and expertise in design problem solving. In order to provide empirical evidence, a series of controlled experiments were conducted to examine how this cognitive strategy contributed to the enhancement of design problem solving in each group of subjects. Students and architects were asked to solve a set of non-routine design problems stimulated by exposure to between-domain and within-domain visual displays, and were given explicit instructions to use analogy. Results showed that both novices and experts were able to reason by visual analogy and use deep analogs. It was found that experts identified and retrieved analogs from between-domain displays. Novices, however, identified a large number of between-domain displays, but retrieved analogs from between-domain and within-domain displays in the same measure. Novices, in contrast to experts, did not add constraints to the design problem, but produced a large number of solutions. These findings have important implications on design education. It is proposed that training novice students in the use of visual analogy can play a significant role to develop design skills in the architectural design studio. What are the differences between expert and novice performance in the domain of design? How can we help designers solve non-routine design problems while using familiar knowledge structures?  The production of an unlimited number of unexpected solutions that are significantly different from earlier designs is a characteristic of non-routine design. Design problems are described as major examples of non-routine problems (Gero and Maher 1993). In design, visual analogy is a powerful problem solving strategy that can help explain new and non-routine problems in terms of familiar ones. Although there is some evidence that problem solvers have difficulty in making spontaneous use of this strategy, references concerning the use of analogy are mostly anecdotal. Moreover, differences in expertise as regards the use of visual analogy in design have rarely been reported. The main goal of this study is to provide empirical evidence regarding differences and similarities in the performance of expert and novice designers whose reasoning process involves visual analogy. Qualitative and quantitative results in the use of visual analogy during the design process are presented following a brief literature review.""This paper compares stochastic processes used for designing sound and space: an interdisciplinary transference of generative techniques. The mathematical conceptualisation and graphical visualisation by expert architect, Le Corbusier and expert designer and composer, Iannis Xenakis form a single basis applicable to generative systems in two disparate disciplines. Expertise is related to a form of transformational analogy and to designing the grammatical, generative system rather than the artefact itself. Le Corbusier and Xenakis are considered from two angles: to compare the way in which interdisciplinary and conceptualised design planning is implemented by expert designers; and to examine the potential for generative systems in a multi-disciplinary context. The usefulness of the latter lies in connecting disparate disciplines and as a basis for generative computation spanning discreet design domains, for example multimedia installation design. The comparison also highlights the extent of expert designers’ formalisation and conceptualisation that occurs graphically and mathematically before implementation in the chosen design domain. It is interesting that the designers’ focus lies in developing the generative system and defining its relation to musical or architectural grammar, rather than in designing the artefact itself.""This paper reports on the novel design and user-trialling of a prototype device to simulate the muscular coordination and sensations of a complex whole body activity with particular reference to snow skiing. Simulation and its benefits are well documented in the fields of aviation and medicine. However, there is little published evidence that simulation is effective in acquiring complex whole-body skills and control necessary in the sporting arena. In scope, this paper covers development of a machine for simulating down-hill skiing. The aims of this research were twofold: Firstly, to design and construct a machine to simulate the physical and sensory aspects of down-hill skiing; and secondly, to user trial and evaluate the effectiveness of this device using expert skiers. The paper begins with an introduction and brief literature search, followed by details of the design process involved in the development of the actual simulator. The results of the user trials have found a significant agreement between the simulated and actual physical and sensory aspects of whole body activity in the field of snow skiing."
